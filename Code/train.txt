Seriously,  how  can  anyone  believe  redstate  would  post  anything  other  than  negative  about  anything  related  to  Hillary,  but  it  agrees  with  my  bias  so  it  must  be  true __label__0

Given  that  the  Affordable  Care  Act  was  implemented  in  its  cost-reducing  entirety  in  2009,  this  certainly  seems  like  a  major  blow  to  the  Obama  administration's  health  care  plan... __label__1
He's  eligible  for  the  Selective  Service  draft  as  of  3  years  ago...  but  all  20  somethings  have  an  iffy  history  with  the  law,  so  it's  all  good. __label__0

Yeah  like  all  of  those  traders  who  shorted  REITs  a  few  months  ago,  they  must  be  crying  their  eyes  out  about  all  those  dividends  they  had  to  cough  up. __label__1
Gee  it'd  be  a  shame  we  don't  get  to  see  who  he'd  invite  to  sit  next  to  Melania  at  the  State  of  the  Union  every  year. __label__0
Well,  when  you  think  Obama  founded  ISIS  and  isn't  even  fighting  them,  it's  easy  to  get  scared  and  need  scorched-earth  boots-on-the-ground  type  war  to  feel  safer. __label__1
It  isn't  your  body  anymore  if  you  let  it  be  healthy,  you've  got  to  let  it  be  in  it's  "natural"  state  for  it  to  classify  as  yours. __label__1

Yes  exactly  why  can't  everyone  have  the  same  music  taste  as  me  so  I  don't  have  to  feel  superior  when  I  hear  someone  listening  to  le  (c)rap? __label__0
"  son,  your  grandma  is  dieing  right  now  in  the  other  room,  i  need  you  to  say  your  good  byes"  "screw  you  mom  let  me  finish  this  game  first" __label__0

But  as  long  as  the  kids  are  getting  good  enough  grades  so  the  teachers  don't  get  in  trouble  and  the  district  doesn't  lose  funding,  it's  all  just  fine. __label__0
But  Bad  Rats  is  a  masterpiece,  why  do  you  think  it  gets  gifted  so  much,  and  how  can  it  be  crap  if  it  got  a  sequel? __label__0

All  I  have  to  suggest,  is  not  to  pick  either  LA  or  Chicago,  because  that  means  you're  a  bandwagon  fan  and  from  what  I've  been  told,  they're  the  worst... __label__1

Because  school  administrators  who  are  so  stereotypically  Democratic  it's  hilarious  want  to  eliminate  all  forms  of  competition  and  pass  out  "EVERYONE'S  A  WINNER"  ribbons  to  the  whole  class. __label__0

I  think  they  play  many  uhc's  in  secret,  but  they  only  record  1  every  few  months  so  that  we  have  to  wait  so  they  get  tons  of  likes/views __label__0
I'm  sure  the  reason  astronauts  don't  light  matches  in  the  space  station  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  risk  of  a  flash  fire  in  the  oxygen  rich  environment. __label__1
That's  not  possible,  he's  played  6  full  games  bro,  we've  seen  enough  to  know  he's  better  than  the  QB  who  holds  basically  every  team  passing  record __label__0
We  get  no  specs,  no  rims,  and  no  colors,  but  at  least  they  were  generous  enough  to  upgrade  the  Miata's  brakes  to  drilled  rotors  for  us __label__0
Yes,  he  made  a  stupid  mistake,  so  he  totally  deserves  to  die,  and  the  driver  of  the  car  deserve  to  carry  that  with  them  their  entire  life... __label__1
so  he  a-moved  banelings  then  clicked  f  SUCH  INCREDIBLE  FUNGALS  HOLY  SHIt  in  low  mmr  (insane  mineral/gas  float)  totally  deserves  a  post  on  reddit  mocking  the  opponent  player. __label__0
if  you  look  to  your  left  you  will  see  Illinois...  it  has  had  a  minimum  wage  of  federal  min  &lt;$1+  for  many  years...  they  are  in  a  great  position __label__0
Cops  are  professionally  trained  to  drive  in  specialised  schools...  this  is  why  they  are  allowed  to  speed  without  flashing  lights,  do  illegal  u-turns  and  text  while  driving. __label__0
Yeah,  why  don't  we  just  put  them  nude,  shelterless,  without  prepared  food  and  clean  water  and  dump  them  in  Alaska  where  they  can  fight  the  bears  for  food! __label__1
But  what  are  they  going  to  add  to  the  PS4s  v2.13  if  they  allowed  all  the  old  features  present  in  last  gen  to  be  available  now? __label__0
Because  there  is  no  way  that  you  could  do  that  to  your  own  face  while  hiding  in  the  woods  for  7  weeks  and  running  from  the  cops. __label__0
Did  you  know  that  they  are  in  stock  around  you  and  also  that  they  stop  playing  music  when  you  remove  one  of  them  from  your  ears? __label__0
She  said  it's  the  gold  standard  of  trade  agreements  and  has  lobbied  for  over  3  years  for  it  but  I'm  sure  he's  not  really  for  it __label__0
You  have  convinced  me  that  my  opinion  on  anime  is  inferior  to  yours,  and  I  will  immediately  change  my  opinion  to  be  more  in  line  with  yours,  master. __label__0
Last  2  games:  Mitro,  2  goals,  Ayoze,  3  goals,  Gayle,  0  Goals  Ipswich  and  PNE  soooo,  Mitro  is  clearly  our  best  bet,  as  we've  known  all  along __label__0
Hurr  durr  someone  disagrees  with  me  and  doesn't  believe  that  wealth  is  something  to  be  disparaged  cause  I'm  not  a  retarded  socialist  so  they  must  be  a  TROLL. __label__1
Yeah  obviously  she  used  $6  million  to  hire  +5k  people  to  vote  and  post  on  reddit  for  5  months  straight  for  a  whooping  66  cents  per  hour __label__1
No,  they  need  super  metal  looking  dudes  standing  by  them  with  black  shirts  and  black  backgrounds,  making  angry  as  fuck  faces  with  a  grungy  texture  over  everything! __label__1
Guys  all  we  want  is  some  reasonable  gun  regulations  jeez,  just  let  us  ratchet  the  regulations  down  a  little  more  is  all  we  want  for  now __label__0
In  a  way  he's  doing  her  a  favour  by  letting  her  know  how  crappy  of  a  person  he  is  right  off  the  bat  instead  of  further  down  the  line. __label__0
Its  like  the  lambo  suv,  its  for  when  you  need  to  pick  up  the  kids  from  soccer  practice  at  5  and  hit  the  track  at  5:30. __label__0
Look,  it's  not  a  logical  leap  to  say  that  if  you  took  a  picture  of  yourself  with  a  gun  and  have  smoked  marijuana  you're  going  to  kill  people. __label__0
$10  OP  wants  to  do  something  crazy  with  trading  cards  and  is  just  trying  to  get  you  all  to  sell  them  to  him  on  the  cheap __label__0
No,  because  it's  not  okay  for  little  girls  to  try  to  be  masculine,  but  it's  perfectly  okay  to  make  all  boys  act  feminine  and  never  explore  their  masculinity. __label__1
Nah  man,  the  people  in  Paris  care  more  about  what  happened  in  a  dota  2  tournament  right  now,  they  dont  have  other  things  to  worry  about... __label__1
The  LORD  will  come  down  and  defeat  these  socialist  commies  with  an  AR-15  in  hand  with  an  army  of  aborted  fetuses  behind  him  all  with  their  own  1911s. __label__1
Yeah  because  if  there's  any  place  that's  likely  to  give  men  custody  of  their  children  and  leave  financial  support  to  the  women,  it's  2nd  and  3rd  world  countries. __label__0
Yea,  I  mean  if  you  *don't*  pull  out  a  gun,  obviously  you  are  a  coward  and  you  don't  love  your  girl  as  much  as  the  other  guy. __label__0
True,  people  are  sending  40%  more  dick  pics  and  liking  50%  more  facebook  posts...  these  SOC  just  aren't  keeping  up  with  the  extreme  demands  users  place  on  them! __label__0
Ya  more  than  double  the  current  output,  drop  a  few  hundred  pounds,  drop  the  price  by  at  least  $6000,  why  didn't  they  do  that  in  the  first  place? __label__1
Meeting  up  with  my  friends  in  our  awesome  9000  member  faction,  travelling  the  solar  system  killing  everyone  and  everything  we  meet  and  naming  everything  after  my  dick. __label__1
I  completely  understand  how  it  is  impossible  to  wait  another  30  seconds  to  a  minute  after  a  flight  of  up  to  several  hours...  That  last  0.5%  is  the  hardest. __label__1
I  can  use  my  nexus  6  to  detect  earthquakes  without  any  app...  I  just  let  it  flat  on  the  table  and  it  will  swing  before  an  earthquake __label__0
It'll  be  faster  for  you  too,  since  the  cable  is  like  a  slide  for  the  data  your  speeds  will  be  way  faster  than  what  he  will  ever  get! __label__0
My  excuse  is  that  I've  not  figured  out  what  I  want  to  do  with  my  life  yet  and  if  needed  I'll  just  take  a  MOOC  later  on. __label__0
They  must  be  doing  well,  I  aven't  seen  anything  about  Libya  in  a  few  years  so  we  must  have  a  done  a  good  job  of  the  place. __label__1
He  made  the  courageous  and  self-realized  move  of  getting  a  drunk  blowjob  from  a  guy  he  knew  was  bisexual,  and  already  had  his  head  inches  from  his  crotch. __label__0
Way  to  stick  it  to  the  white  man..  If  Che  were  alive  he  would  beat  up  every  street  vendor  seeling  a  t-shirt  with  his  name  on  it! __label__1
Don't  you  know  that  if  Apple  isn't  doing  the  exact  same  things  that  it  was  when  Steve  Jobs  was  there  and  nothing  else,  they've  lost  focus? __label__1
Too  much  work  I  just  want  to  brag  to  my  boys  how  big  and  badass  my  dog  is  and  beat  it  for  every  mistake  at  home  it  makes... __label__1
Obviously  not  gay  bro,  you  really  think  a  guy  like  Steven  is  a  disgusting  sodamite...  Maybe  he  just  enjoys  sharing  his  kiddy  porn  with  his  preschool  wingman? __label__0
Photo  is  *obviously*  fake,  SF  is  too  expensive  and  no  one  just  "has  a  dollar  just  in  their  pocket"  ready  to  use  for  scale  like  that. __label__1
I  love  it,  totally  worth  getting  boosted  to  get  promoted  to  an  elo  where  you  lose  the  game  and  ruin  it  for  the  players  that  are  there  legitimately __label__0
Yeah,  removing  44  armor  from  a  champion  for  no  real  good  reason  other  than  an  item  overcompensating  AD  junglers  seemed  like  a  really  intelligent  move  at  the  time __label__0
Yup  that's  why  they  called  a  bad  out  of  bounds  call  in  game  5,  and  specifically  zoomed  in  on  Kyrie's  Nike  Irving  2's...  for  the  $$ __label__0
well  YOU  try  making  a  living  raising  3  kids  as  a  minimum  wage  slave,  when  some  penny  pinching  personal  financier  only  tips  you  about  20%  gotta  make  those  ducats __label__1
We  don't  want  people  playing  it  just  for  the  cycle,  so  we're  raising  it  to  seven  mana  so  that  it  can't  be  used  with  cult  master. __label__1
Well  they  didn't  have  all  the  information  (only  some  of  the  pictures),  so  it's  better  to  just  look  at  the  pictures  ourselves  and  form  our  own  conclusions... __label__0
"Eurghmergurd  he  only  did  two  keepy  uppies  before  vollying  it  in  the  first  video  -  sell  him  now,  get  him  this  cancer  out  of  our  club" __label__1
Forget  about  about  homosexuality,  personally  I  think  we  should  bring  back  stoning  to  death  of  Adulterers  and  punish  all  the  heathens  having  babies  out  of  wedlock... __label__1
I  mean,  you  just  need  to  get  some  wool,  rub  it  between  your  two  hands  till  you  get  a  string,  then  make  some  sort  of  beehive  looking  thing,  right? __label__1
How  dare  the  343  nonprofit  organization  make  a  purely  cosmetic  skin  and  charge  money  for  it  while  making  it  cost  a  ton  of  free  in  game  currency! __label__0
Conveniently  placed  on  the  boarder  with  mexico,  oh  no  that's  not  a  clever  sanctuary  for  the  immigration  laws  he  doesn't  want  to  enforce  nope  not  at  all. __label__0
I'm  not  sure  if  a  rocket  powered  robot  fucking  a  human  is  going  to  have  a  clean  aftermath  but  the  orgasm  will  be  fantastic  I'm  sure. __label__1
Well,  at  least  he's  going  to  kill  himself  after  he  gets  to  a  million,  so  we  don't  have  to  waste  any  time  being  concerned  for  the  next  999,996  women! __label__0
i  played  a  public  match  of  shadows  and  on  round  14  i  had  28  revives...  that  was  the  night  i  started  drinking  bleach  to  help  me  sleep __label__1
I  was  making  a  joke,  but  feel  free  to  continue  lecturing  me  about  my  profession;  I  love  being  talked  to  about  editing  and  directing  like  I'm  an  idiot. __label__1
Yes,  because  knowing  the  races  of  the  finalists  of  the  10  most  recent  premier  tournaments  is  the  only  knowledge  you  need  in  order  to  make  balance  decisions. __label__0
Yep,  all  those  millions  of  available  civilian  jobs,  combined  with  our  super  low  cost  of  education,  certainly  make  this  a  viable  option  for  so  many  of  our  Servicemen. __label__0
I  also  feel  the  need  to  express  my  dominance  over  a  nice  person  who  shares  my  interests  because  I  am  also  a  sad  excuse  for  a  human. __label__1
Yes,  let  me  order  the  most  expensive  camera  and  assume  it  has  everything  I  want  instead  of  taking  two  minutes  to  look  at  what  features  it  actually  has. __label__1
But  do  we  really  want  to  teach  "  you  have  3  apples,  and  because  you  are  a  shitty  businessman  you  now  owe  more  apples  than  you  own?" __label__1
The  only  released  when  it  starts  in  PST,  we  will  have  to  wait  until  they  announce  the  EST  release  time  since  it  is  impossible  to  convert  between  the  two __label__1
Since  when  is  it  not  okay  to  climb  over  the  wall  of  a  bathroom  stall  and  snap  a  picture  of  what's  going  on  on  the  other  side? __label__0
Right,  not  to  mention  that  when  they  die  they  go  to  paradise  and  get  72  virgins,  so  we  definitely  should  not  try  to  kill  the  terrorists. __label__1
I  don't  know  what  you  are  complaining  about,  its  not  like  there  are  any  Pokemon  in  the  rural  areas  to  throw  the  pokeballs  at  any  way. __label__1
Hey  if  we  have  to  mentally  and/or  physically  scar  a  few  people  to  bring  a  community  together  for  a  good  time,  then  I  think  its  worth  it! __label__1
But  if  it's  the  most  difficult  in  the  US  it  must  be  the  most  difficult  in  the  world  since  US  is  the  best  country  in  everything! __label__0
Just  like  every  other  time  that  arms  get  parachuted  or  otherwise  fall  into  the  hands  of  whoever,  I'm  totally  sure  that  this  time  is  an  accident  as  well. __label__1
and  I  am  sure  the  Republicans  who  wasted  millions  of  dollars  having  a  thousand  investigations  over  Benghazi  will  be  sure  to  question  Comey  on  his  partisan  efforts __label__0
Yeah,  because  all  of  the  hotels,  restaurants,  and  casinos  are  just  going  to  shut  down  for  an  afternoon  because  all  their  employees  requested  the  day  off. __label__1
Yes,  but  believing  there  is  a  puppet  master  in  the  sky  who  has  planned  all  of  our  lives  for  us  makes  you  a  perfectly  rational  and  respectable  human. __label__0
yeah  well  intersectionlity  says  ur  rich  which  means  i  dont  care  about  hate  crimes  against  u  because  if  ur  not  oppressed  and  still  hated  it  must  be  justified __label__0
We  can't  allow  little  things  like  civil  liberties  stop  us  from  hunting  down  agents  of  the  ~~godless  communist~~  radical  islamic  terrorist  conspiracy,  no  matter  where  they  hide. __label__0
yeah  i  would  have  totally  preferred  to  watch  a  slow  game  with  8  kills  where  1  team  just  slowly  loses  the  game  without  any  fights  happening. __label__1
If  he  wants  to  keep  the  guns  realistic  he  should  just  ignore  left  handed  people,  like  the  gun  manufacturers  have  been  doing  for  hundreds  of  years. __label__0
Hm,  perhaps  he  was  asking  so  that  you  could  be  woo'd  by  his  orgasm-inducing  abilities  of  manliness  that  are  *far*  superior  to  anything  you've  ever  had  before. __label__0
I'm  just  saying,  I  don't  care  if  dragons  come  out  of  my  arrow  if  it  travels  so  slowly  some  dude  has  the  time  to  spawn  his  own  dragon. __label__0
You  should  be  ashamed  of  yourself  for  not  understanding  the  government  hates  you  and  is  part  of  a  mass  conspiracy  to  take  all  of  your  money  and  freedumb. __label__1
Especially  if  you  have  no  idea  why  you're  voting  and  have  no  desire  to  ever  know  the  policies  and  plans  of  the  person  you're  voting  for. __label__0
well  duh  if  you  don't  hate  muslims  you  hate  the  lgbt  it  doesn't  take  a  massive  jump  to  get  to  that  conclusion  its  just  logic,  cuck. __label__0
He'd  get  her  in  a  rear  naked  choke  and  it'd  be  lights  out  in  under  15  secs,  not  sure  why  this  is  even  being  considered  as  an  even  fight... __label__0
But  they  need  100  round  magazines  and  armored  vehicles  so  that  we  can  prepare  for  the  inevitable  terrorist  invasion  (has  nothing  to  do  with  rise  of  fascism...) __label__0
As  I  understand  it,  you  have  total  human  rights  as  a  fetus,  which  you  completely  relinquish  at  birth  and  you  don't  get  them  back  until  you  turn  18. __label__1
At  this  point  i  just  want  to  see  americans  burn  their  country  down  before  Trump  even  gets  elected  and  then  Trump  will  issue  a  new  world  order __label__0
Yeah,  someone  has  a  different  opinion  as  me,  I  have  to  try  to  insult  him  because  I'm  the  only  one  who  is  allowed  to  be  right. __label__1
It  will  be  a  "per  publisher  decision"  whether  to  port  their  year  old  games  to  a  new  platform  or  not  so  not  all  hope  is  lost. __label__0
Well  as  we  know,  the  war  on  drugs  was  won  over  30  years  ago  and  since  then  we've  lived  in  a  world  with  very  little  drug  use. __label__0
Oh  I  love  it,  sometimes  i  dont  see  it  the  first  time,  or  the  second  time,  but  that  third  and  fourth  time  really  helps  to  get  my  attention __label__0
Seeing  you  don't  need  a  valid  passport  to  board  an  international  flight  I  doubt  one  would  need  to  go  through  the  trouble  and  hide  inside  the  plane. __label__0
Can't  you  imagine  how  immersive  it  would  be  if  they  didn't  show  us  those  squares  and  we  just  clicked  on  an  area  and  hoped  it  was  a  square? __label__1
Yeah,  no  Value  town,  no  Deck  Wars  (or  maybe  by  different  team),  no  shows  from  other  games  -  but  at  least  people  got  their  wish  and  sapped  Chanman __label__1
Yeah  I  specifically  liked  the  part  where  they  gave  OP  a  citation  for  a  broken  window  and  overgrown  shrubbery  and  gave  the  junkie  a  ride  home  instead. __label__0
Well  then  it's  definitely  a  horrible  idea  to  add  more  density  there,  what  with  all  that  sexy  new  public  transit  just  a  hop  and  a  skip  away. __label__1
Shame  on  him  for  being  influenced  by  another  comic  and  then  having  the  audacity  to  make  his  own  unique  version  and  then  give  credit  and  link  to  the  original. __label__1
Uh  yeah  thats  why  Trump  said  he  would  overturn  gay  marriage  and  thats  why  Pence  has  a  proven  record  of  such  positivity  with  the  LGBT  community! __label__0
It's  admirable  if  you're  a  3  and  D  guy  in  the  league  but  it's  deplorable  that  DeAndre  Jordan  can  make  a  living  the  way  he  does. __label__0
i  got  into  a  league  crash  because  i  wasn't  watching  the  minimap  every  5  seconds  :L  league  ed  would  have  saved  a  life  and  a  match __label__0
Jokes  on  you  because  in  Bruce  Wayne's  birthday  party  in  batman  begins  there's  not  a  single  black  person  to  be  seen  on  camera  so  batman  is  racist! __label__0
Its  funny  because  I  am  a  reddit  fedora  and  I  never  get  a  raise  because  I  am  socially  awkward  and  I  like  to  blame  my  boss  for  it! __label__0
Git  gud  I  never  miss  CS  I  farm  all  3  lanes  and  both  jungles  if  you  can't  do  this  you  shouldn't  be  playing  meepo  GG  noob  meepo __label__0
I'm  really  looking  forward  to  being  able  to  complain  about  my  local  LCBOs  shitty  IPA  and  sour  beer  selection,  AS  WELL  AS  their  horrible  strains  of  indica. __label__0
Yes,  Samus  Aran  must  be  transgender  because  cis  women  can't  be  tall  Amazonian  warriors  oh  no  she  must  have  had  a  male  body  in  order  to  do  that. __label__1
It's  different  though,  because  Muslims  aren't  white  and  we  all  know  that  non-white  people  can't  be  held  to  the  same  standards  as  us  enlightened  white  people. __label__0
Yep,  targeting  a  specific  sub  and  making  up  arbitrary  rules  for  them  is  totally  cool  as  long  as  it  is  done  to  a  sub  I  disagree  with. __label__0
I  swear  to  god,  if  this  were  American  police,  everybody  would  be  absolutely  tearing  them  to  shreds,  but  no,  this  is  British  police,  so  it's  perfectly  excusable __label__0
Yeah,  the  hype  has  been  dead  a  long  time  ago,  there's  only  5-10  post  a  day  about  sombra  now,  nobody  remember  her,  and  nobody  care  anymore __label__1
downvotes  don't  go  far  enough,  what  if  that  terrible  hate  speech  got  upvotes,  think  about  all  the  people  that  could  be  triggered  and  feel  unsafe  because  of  it. __label__1
NO,  because  my  religion  has  a  very  narrow  interpretation  of  how  god  wants  us  all  to  be  and  so  they  must  conform  to  my  rules  because  god  said  so.... __label__0
No,  it's  okay  for  fat  people  to  make  fun  of  other  fat  people,  like  how  blacks  can  call  other  blacks  the  N  word  but  no  one  else  can. __label__1
Well,  what  else  are  they  supposed  to  do  when  the  are  being  oppressed  so  much  that  they  can't  keep  their  sectarian  prayer  hanging  up  on  government  property? __label__0
[I  thought  this  Jaina  is  a  Dreadlord  was  just  a  little  joke,  but  after  doing  the  Alliance  starting  experience  in  the  Beta  I  really  think  she  might  be.] __label__1
Oh  man  you  got  me,  a  political  discussion  in  the  capitol  held  on  the  taxpayers  dime,  this  is  a  once  in  a  life  time  deal  right  here! __label__0
Nah,  Perkz  is  a  piece  of  shit  and  he  should  get  about  90%  of  all  the  blame  with  the  rest  of  the  blame  going  to  Ocelote. __label__1
I  seriously  thought  you  were  still  trolling  (albeit  poorly),  but  apparently  that  really  is  the  underlying  message...  So  fucking  rich,  keep  it  on  man,  it  looks  GREAT! __label__0
Oh  my  god  who  thought  that  apple  would  release  the  iphone  5s  in  September,  it's  not  like  they  have  been  doing  it  for  the  last  two  years. __label__1
Yea,  hell  why  even  teach  history  in  schools  no  one  needs  that  old  history  lesson  to  see  how  we  have  gotten  to  where  we  are  today __label__1
Farage  thinks  that  Germany  and  France  will  launch  an  invasion  of  Britain  if  the  UK  leaves  the  EU  so  that's  why  he  wants  to  increase  military  spending. __label__0
Since  Intel  has  been  calling  their  processors  with  prime  numbers  (Core  2  quad,  Core  i3,  i5,  i7),  the  next  should  be  the  i11  and  the  i13. __label__0
Right,  because  literally  every  single  wireless  AV  technology  works  the  same  way,  which  is  why  there's  no  need  for  dedicated  hardware  like  a  Steam  Link  to  even  exist __label__1
Oh,  I  agree  with  skeptics  in  general  when  they  say  there's  no  evidence  for  god,  but  those  New  Skeptics  are  making  everything  worse  for  the  rest  of  us. __label__1
Well  clearly  because  he's  a  special  snowflake  he  deserves  to  beat  that  guy,  it's  the  non-cheater's  fault  for  not  knowing  that  exploiting  is  required  in  the  dark  zone...duh. __label__0
I  enjoy  playing  with  people  that  never  talk  or  call  out  anything  but  only  when  you're  the  last  man  standing  and  they  start  complaining  about  you  playing  bad. __label__0
This  is  clearly  a  positive  externality,  and  so  his  neighbors  should  be  taxed  to  subsidize  him  so  that  he  produces  the  socially  optimal  amount  of  BBQ  smell. __label__0
No  I  am  really  convinced  that  X  is  completely  negative  in  every  situation  and  Y  is  positive,  where  X  and  Y  are  fighting  each  other  and  I  support  Y. __label__0
But  I  thought  everyone  on  Reddit  knew  this  game  was  going  to  be  the  biggest  game  ever  and  niantic  was  stupid  for  not  allocating  enough  servers. __label__0
So  glad  they  got  the  items  and  class  builder  out  so  early  -  gives  us  lots  of  chance  to  waste  time  until  the  release  in  Q1  2012... __label__0
Yeah,  he  clearly  must  not  have  been  swinging  very  hard  because  it  took  three  full  swings  to  break  the  two-inch-diameter  piece  of  wood  in  half  over  his  buddy's  neck. __label__1
The  one  true  God  (weak3n)  is  not  a  fan  of  saving  people  who  let  themselves  get  games  so  no  jungler  should  volunteer  farm  time  to  save  people __label__0
With  that  logic  we  should  be  able  to  see  where  our  teammates  are  targetting  and  we  should  see  bullet  decals  so  we  know  where  their  bullets  are  going __label__0
Yes,  since  in  other  countries  where  pot  is  decriminalized,  and  in  some  cases  sold  in  shops,  have  seen  a  huge  rises  in  the  consumption  of  cannabis  by  its  citizen. __label__1
An  amazing  run  considering  he  is  a  couple  of  hundred  thousand  feet  above  the  ground,  that  would  be  a  truly  terrifying  death  if  he  were  to  fall  off... __label__1
Yes  obviously  I  also  broke  my  cat's  legs  and  this  is  why  she  was  unable  to  run  off  the  air  mattress  when  I  was  clearly  abusing  her. __label__1
Washington  is  so  stacked  they  have  the  offensive  rookie  of  the  year  as  their  third  string  QB,  I'm  going  to  call  them  the  ohio  state  of  the  NFL. __label__0
Ya;  because  2015  will  be  the  year  that  Scrooge  McBernie  spent  raking  in  millions  from  lobbyists,  creating  offshore  shell  companies  and  lighting  cigars  with  hundred  dollar  bills. __label__1
two  day  of  the  dead  skins  in  the  keys&amp;drones  tab  of  the  market...  welp  looks  like  i  can't  use  the  market  until  the  limited  offer  ends __label__1
How  rude  of  you  -  that  person  did  a  lot  work  to  holding  the  mug  under  the  spigot  as  they  pulled  the  lever  to  fill  the  mug. __label__0
Because  sheep  were  totally  incapable  of  surviving  on  their  own  before  humans  and  dogs  came  along,  i'm  sure  the  dog  is  the  reason  they  survived  for  months. __label__0
That's  strange  because  I  recall  a  man  in  a  car  trying  to  race  me  in  my  3  series  some  time  ago  and  he  stalled  it  off  the  line... __label__1
So  much  salt  in  here..  Yeah  OP,  you  should  make  yourself  as  large  a  target  as  possible  so  it's  easier  for  the  enemy  to  kill  you! __label__0
But  lets  not  forget,  these  self-employed  people  with  no  customers  just  need  to  strive  harder...  be  more,  entrepreneurial..  and  they  too  can  live  the  good  life! __label__1
Wow  you  should  petition  those  Titan  losses  then  huh,  clearly  the  result  of  the  sov  bill  and  not  because  it  was  a  stupid  idea  to  jump  in __label__0
On  the  bright  side,  half  of  0%  is  still  0%  so  our  chances  of  getting  the  skin  don't  really  diminish  now  that  the  event  is  over. __label__0
But  it's  cuse  of  those  crazy  Ys  that  all  those  Xs  are  running  around,  no  Ys  no  Xs,  it's  THEIR  FAULT  I  TELL  YOU  DON'T  BLAME  ME. __label__0
Impulsive  bitcoin  hodlers  should  spend  their  bitcoins  to  1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE  as  it  will  take  quite  a  long  time  to  recover  the  private  keys  for  spending,  thus  saving  you  from  yourself. __label__0
Yep,  we  should  be  getting  kids  ready  so  they  can  go  out  and  get  a  welding  job  at  the  age  of  12  to  help  support  their  family. __label__0
Bunch  of  workshy  scroungers  unwilling  to  work  as  hard  as  their  robot  colleagues,  bet  the  poor  robots  will  have  to  foot  the  bill  for  them  as  usual. __label__0
The  tag  on  the  post  says  that  it's  not  the  cammer,  but  of  course  we  all  know  that  the  cammer  is  completely,  100%  at  fault  here. __label__0
Yes  because  some  nobody  like  you  obviously  knows  how  riot  should  run  their  company..  You  know  so  much  more  about  running  a  moba  than  everyone  at  riot  combined. __label__0
I  hope  there's  a  scene  with  Tony  Stark  and  Stephen  Strange  where  someone  says  something  like  "No  shit,  Sherlock"  and  they  both  look  at  each  other  or  something. __label__1
Careful  there  mister  communism,  if  we  don't  keep  funneling  money  upwards  to  pay  the  glorious  job  creators,  how  will  the  poor  guys  be  able  to  continue  creating  jobs? __label__0
Yeah,  with  all  those  scientists  fleeing  advanced  countries  to  head  for  North  Korea,  I'm  sure  the  DPRK  will  have  the  technology  to  do  that  any  day  now... __label__0
Are  you  sure  it's  not  like  the  cables  for  jumping  a  car,  where  you  place  the  red  cable  on  the  black  and  the  black  cable  on  the  red? __label__0
Dr  Soderholm  is  obviously  a  fraud,  since  we  all  know  that  every  single  storm  in  SEQ  contains  EXTREMELY  DANGEROUS  SUPERCELLS,  MASSIVE  HAIL  and  at  least  one  ROTATING  VORTEX. __label__0
Attack  it  all,  attack  anything  and  everything  that  appears  against  my  chosen  platform,  if  it  debates,  it  is  the  enemy,  it  is  wrong  and  is  likely  a  social-commie-terrorist. __label__0
But  of  course  there  aren't  any  brits  on  the  sites  to  see  these  new  adverts  thanks  to  the  highly  effective  blocks  our  glorious  leaders  have  put  in  place. __label__0
Ya,  if  it's  wrong  for  a  black  kid  to  slam  a  kind  of  white  looking  guy's  head  into  the  concrete  then  I  don't  know  what's  wrong  with  this  world. __label__0
If  we  can't  convince  the  US  to  get  rid  of  there  nukes  we  may  as  well  just  build  a  wall  to  keep  them  away  from  us __label__1
How  to  fix  the  "problem"  with  the  unified  Windows  8  UI:  Separate  it  into  3  separate  versions,  one  of  which  is  still  the  same  as  the  original. __label__1
I  think  that  the  the  police  should  stop  responding  to  shootings,  stabbings,  and  batteries  and  start  staking  out  random  cars  to  prevent  catalytic  converters  from  being  stolen. __label__1
B-b-b-but  in  Star  Trek  they  can  time  travel  whenever  they  want  cuz  Kirk  did  it  twice  by  slingshotting  around  the  sun  and  totally  didn't  make  plot  holes __label__0
But  don't  you  see,  we  internet  strangers  are  much  better  at  life  and  are  much  more  qualified  to  tell  her  how  to  live  hers  than  she  could  ever  be! __label__0
Yes  because  the  constant  shady  practices  and  customer  abuse  Facebook  has  been  proven  to  have  been  engaged  in  over  and  over  and  over  are  all  In  our  imaginations. __label__0
Ward  clerk  here,  we'll  just  need  the  following:  *  Name  *  Birthdate  *  SSN  *  Fingerprints  *  Credit  check  *  FBI  background  check  *  15  year  job  history __label__0
All  the  other  guesses  are  wrong,  because  if  the  poor  man  had  seen  that  no  one  had  a  gun,  he  would've  dropped  the  crowbar  and  ran  away. __label__0
Shox  going  to  majors  with  6  different  teams,  hmmm  I  sense  a  constant  factor  here.....  Yep  it's  smithzzz  he  was  in  5  of  those  6  teams  :^) __label__1
Yes,  Peter  Jackson,  the  man  that  fought  tooth-and-nail  to  get  the  LOTR  movies  made  in  the  first  place,  had  to  be  forcibly  stopped  from  deliberately  ruining  them. __label__1
Take  it  easy  there  bro,  we  all  know  it  wasn't  his  fault,  he  just  had  to  catch  some  ZzZ's  from  the  treachorous  6-hour  trip  from  LA  to  Kingsburg. __label__0
i  know  right,  Universities  are  the  bastion  of  mediocrity,  if  only  these  people  spent  a  week  in  the  average  office  they  would  know  true  work  and  excellence. __label__0
If  they  say  to  you  at  the  next  wedding  along  the  lines  of  "that'll  be  you  next",  do  the  same  to  them  at  the  next  funeral. __label__0
That's  obviously  because  Microsoft  made  it  so  their  tablet  would  recognize  Chrome  and  make  it  run  slower  on  purpose  which  in  turn  makes  IE  look  better  in  comparison. __label__0
They  show  off  the  female  body,  and  since  we  clearly  live  in  the  Victorian  Era,  any  expression  of  sexuality  (Especially  that  of  a  female)  is  "Immoral"  and  "Dehumanizing." __label__1
Yeah,  even  if  you  ignore  that  op  posted  fom  a  main  stream  news  source,  you  would  be  really  hard  pressed  to  find  anything  negative  about  the  Clintons. __label__0
The  depiction  of  hot  women  is  clearly  always  inherently  and  necessarily  used  only  for  the  sole  purpose  of  diminishing  and  objectifying  every  woman  in  the  world,  you  didn't  hear? __label__0
Plus  you  have  to  *bag  your  own  shit  and  also  pay  for  bags  if  you  want  them,  and  loan  a  cart  for  25  cents*  Too  much  work,  yo. __label__1
At  this  point  Hollywood  ought  to  just  throw  caution  to  the  wind  and  remake  all  successful  films  after  a  period  of  no  later  than  5  years. __label__0
Ill  never  buy  an  electric  car  till  they  have  100k  miles  of  range,  I  don't  want  to  deal  with  the  convenience  of  charging  at  home,  ever! __label__1
Well,  if  you  look  at  the  cinematography,  how  the  camera  focuses  on  her  tits  while  she  is  being  tortured  etc  it's  obvious  sexualisation  was  not  on  the  developers  mind... __label__0
So  ungrateful  OP,  he  was  willing  to  give  you  a  shot  as  long  as  you  were  willing  to  change  and  grow  (mentally,  not  physically  obviously)...what  a  guy. __label__0
Yeah  it's  totally  fair  to  punish  people  because  the  game  is  so  buggy  that  thousands  of  users  can't  connect  only  find  it  out  once  they  start  a  match. __label__0
This  was  a  great  topic  for  me  to  find  about  about  for  the  first  time  as  I  was  getting  into  bed  to  go  to  sleep  last  night. __label__0
Well  hopefully  in  a  Mitt  Romney  presidency  we  can  get  rid  of  our  last  source  of  unbiased  news  (NPR)  or,  better  yet,  replace  them  with  a  Fox  Radio  station. __label__0
Only  Islam  is  allowed  to  double  as  both  a  race  and  religion,  get  to  the  back  of  the  bus  with  the  rest  of  the  white  cis  male  scum. __label__0
I  watched  True  Detective  and  turned  into  a  philosopher,  then  I  watched  cosmos  and  turned  into  a  scientist,  lastly  I  watched  breaking  bad,  now  I'm  cooking  Meth. __label__1
Too  bad  there  isn't  an  easily  accessible  place  with  lots  of  information  people  can  go  to  to  find  out  more  about  their  conditions,  treatment  options  and  medication  risks/benefits. __label__1
Let's  celebrate  2016  that  won't  include  any  real  things  to  celebrate  about:  no  LRT  yet,  no  downtown  hockey  arena,  no  new  downtown  library,  just  a  few  Syrian  refugees! __label__0
Everything  is  clear  now,  all  the  complaints  and  whining  about  shipping  posted  here  are  actually  scalpers  who  dont  know  what  to  say  to  their  buyers  ! __label__1
If  you  buy  anything  in  America  you  are  complicit  in  running  a  Chinese  sweatshop  and  the  blood  of  all  workers  there  who  have  committed  suicide  is  on  your  hands! __label__1
No,  no,  no,  you  see  last  time  we  put  a  corrupt  dictator  in  power  with  only  one  or  two  words,  but  our  new  *three*  word  ideology  changes  everything! __label__0
No,  there  are  specific  rules  when  you  can  and  cannot  rush  the  court  and  if  you  don't  follow  the  rules  you  and  your  fans  are  giant  turdnuggets! __label__1
It's  just  a  minor  visual  bug  guys,  just  wait  untill  they  fix  all  the  major  bugs  and  we  get  out  of  the  beta,  after  that  you  can  complain. __label__0
Yes  because  that's  clearly  the  solution  for  any  problem  you  might  have,  and  not  for  revenge  and  personal  satisfaction  arising  from  it  or  anything  like  that,  right? __label__0
Umm,  actually  the  worst  case  scenario  is  you  fuck  up  the  timings,  voltage,  and  multiplier  so  much  it  fries  your  entire  system...but  you  know,  OC  is  "idiot  proof" __label__0
So  does  that  mean  the  whole  Pixar  Theory  did  and  superheroes,  monsters  and  magic  exist  and  our  emotions  are  caused  by  tiny  beings  in  our  head? __label__0
And  since  every  release  of  Office  for  Mac  has  been  both  right  on  time  compared  to  its  counterparts,  and  exceptionally  functional  and  a  dramatic  improvement,  it'll  be  great! __label__0
The  obvious  answer  is  that  there's  no  such  thing  as  lesbians,  and  any  girl  who  claims  to  be  one  is  just  hopping  onto  the  LBGT  bandwagon  for  attention __label__1
step  1)  write  a  bunch  of  shit  step  2)  go  to  cyper  step  3)  spit  written  shit  step  4)  don't  let  anyone  know  you  wrote  it  beforehand __label__0
Yes,  this  makes  complete  sense,  because  when  people  go  on  a  shooting  rampage,  everyone  immediately  charges  the  shooter  to  grab  the  weapons  instead  of  running  for  cover.... __label__0
But  it  makes  complete  sense  that  you  can  carry  twice  as  much  in  a  backpack  than  you  can  store  in  a  massive  crate  in  the  BoO. __label__0
Yeah,  seeing  an  old  man  mistakenly  shot  makes  me  want  to  go  down  to  my  local  police  station  and  target  shoot  as  many  cops  as  I  can. __label__1
Looks  like  a  white  fat  guy  from  the  photos..  damn  what  have  this  world  become  to,  when  even  white  people  can  stab  someone  in  bright  daylight __label__0
I  don't  understand  why  he's  opposed  to  the  leash  when  he's  perfectly  willing  to  crate  her  like  a  puppy  to  keep  her  away  from  the  Christmas  tree. __label__1
Yeah,  credit  card  companies  hire  people  to  look  at  individual  purchases  of  people  and  if  you've  never  bought  a  lingerie  before  they  know  it  isn't  really  you! __label__0
But  don't  you  know  that  calling  other  side  "the  enemy  you  are  most  proud  off"  is  the  best  way  to  get  something  done  in  bipartisan  way? __label__0
I'm  confident  that  when  you  discuss  this  with  your  buddies,  you'll  characterize  this  as  a  discussion  between  an  American  and  yourself,  not  between  a  Jew  and  yourself. __label__0
You're  such  a  genius,  you  just  debunked  all  the  greatest  mysteries  of  life,  I  don't  know  how  you  managed  to  come  to  such  an  amazing  realization,  wow,  bravo. __label__0
You  need  to  draw  cats  like  kids  do:  4  feet  and  all  of  them  are  on  the  same  side  cause  otherwise  it'd  look  like  it  had  2  feet. __label__0
Glad  you  were  able  to  glean  their  entire  personal  situation  from  the  tiny  little  article  you  read  the  title  of  and  made  a  well  informed  judgment  call! __label__0
Wow,  I  guess  I  should  return  my  portable  i3+970  rig  that's  as  big  as  a  PS4  (and  3-4x  as  powerful  as  one)  and  buy  a  console  instead __label__0
Yeah,  I  saw  a  guy  talking  about  babkers  getting  raises  from  bailout  money,  because  bailouts  are  free  money  and  not  emergency  loans  that  were  paid  back  with  interest __label__0
If  Tupac  came  back  to  life  Lil  Wayne  would  suddenly  loose  all  his  money  and  fans  and  then  no  one  would  hire  him  because  of  his  face  tattoos. __label__0
If  you  don't  mind  being  an  option  and  allowing  your  gf/wife  to  have  sex  with  other  guys,  then  you  should  do  whatever  it  takes  to  stay  with  her. __label__0
It  would  be  really  good  if  you  could  use  your  trinket  on  someone  like  malphite  and  not  allow  him  to  use  his  ultimate  on  10  secs __label__0
Totally  understandable  you  friend  had  ounces  of  a  marijuana  which  could  cause  him  to  get  reefer  madness  and  sit  on  the  couch  for  an  hour  or  so. __label__0
Because  posting  a  lost  cat  picture  in  hopes  of  signaling  a  family  who  misses  their  pet  needs  to  be  in  high  quality  or  else  it's  useless. __label__1
Yeah,  I'd  hate  to  see  Star  Wars  taken  away  from  Lucas's  artistic  vision  to  turn  it  into  a  cheap  brand  to  cash  in  on  at  every  opportunity. __label__1
Also  ISIS  is  an  intelligence  agency  in  Archer,  which  is  full  of  people  fucking  and  drinking.They  absolutely  must  change  the  name  now.Lest  they  be  associated  with  such  debaucherous  acts. __label__1
And  the  threats,  and  the  doxing,  and  calling  people  at  their  jobs  and  getting  them  fired,  and  sending  people  syringes....  Some  real  first-class  people,  those  AntiGG  types. __label__0
Ah,  but  he  said  *interested  in*  money,  not  necessarily  possessing  money,  and  I  assume  you're  interested  in  money  since  you  don't  have  it,  so  you  proved  him  right! __label__0
I  accidentally  let  that  [Wrothian  that  storms  a  Ganglion  base  solo  die,  because  I  didn't  know  there  was  a  red  item  orb  nearby  that  saves  her  :(] __label__1
B-but  he's  a  ~~nig~~  ghetto  thug  who  only  raps  about  guns  unlike  this  SHINING  POET  of  a  man  I  only  just  discovered  in  a  YouTube  video! __label__0
Math  smath,  someone  told  me  a  myth  debunked  multiple  times  so  I'm  going  to  stick  my  head  in  the  sand  and  vote  for  corporate  stooges  because  Nader __label__0
Yeah  I'm  sure  her  grandchildren  will  appreciate  your  sentiment,  as  it  is  true  that  she  is  still  like  this  today  and  people  aren't  capable  of  change. __label__0
Well  you  could  just  attach  the  lease  agreement  to  your  bonnet,  you'll  probably  be  so  close  up  someone  else's  arse  they'd  be  able  to  read  it  clearly. __label__0
All  the  Jews  that  could  pay  there  way  out  of  Germany  had  capital  meaning  the  Jews  as  a  race  got  richer,  think  of  all  the  good  Hitler  did __label__0
If  you  order  a  t-shirt  now  you  gotta  pay  for  fast  shipping,  otherwise  he's  gonna  be  on  another  team  by  the  time  it  gets  to  your  house  lol __label__0
I  for  one  look  forward  to  the  day  I  can  take  my  kids  trick  or  treating  and  then  put  them  to  bed  and  go  to  the  midnight  sales. __label__1
A  woman  was  a  victim  of  abuse,  but  the  real  tragedy  here  is  that  a  Nice  Guy  didn't  get  the  sex  he  deserved  until  he  was  19  years  old. __label__0
This  is  another  set  of  'unfortunate  mistakes'  that  she  is  learning  from...  This  helps  make  her  the  best  candidate  ever  since  she  is  learning  soo  much.. __label__0
But  she  needs  all  the  makeup  because  of  society's  high  standards  of  beauty  for  women  which  we  all  know  is  only  to  serve  men's  hunger  for  sex. __label__0
Yeah  but  that's  not  technically  a  "no,"  that's  why  the  euro  girls  are  best  because  they  just  say  "nyet"  or  "nein"  or  "nej"  and  never  "no." __label__1
Yes  are  you  kidding  that's  going  to  encourage  women  to  step  out  of  the  kitchen  we  can't  have  that,  a  lead  role  is  for  a  male __label__0
How  dare  he  do  his  job  and  ask  questions  that  are  relevant  and  give  us  insight  into  what  happened  during  the  fight,  oh  no  so  offensive  and  mean. __label__1
Nah  man  if  Riot  did  it  it  must  be  bad  and  it  is  our  job  to  complain  about  it  make  things  up  if  you  have  to __label__0
Well  I  would  rather  like  to  think  AAP  as  a  BJP  agent  since  what  AAP  is  actually  doing  by  abusing  Modi  and  BJP  is  eating  away  Congress  votes. __label__0
I  see  why  he  drops  it  for  his  stage  name,  but  I  mean  that's  his  real  name  so  he  should  stop  pretending  to  be  something  he's  not. __label__1
Wow,  Big  Brother  must  hire  quite  the  team  of  writers  to  script  24-hour  live  feeds  for  three  months  (usually  with  different  cameras  going  in  two  different  rooms). __label__0
Having  secure  borders,  knowing  who  comes  and  goes  in  your  country,  and  deporting  people  where  illegally  makes  you  a  racist  and  means  you  are  against  all  immigration. __label__1
Hey,  let's  make  an  app  1.2B  people  per  month  will  use,  and  will  generate  almost  4B  in  revenue  every  3  months  and  NOT  protect  the  binary  from  reverse  engineering! __label__1
But  don't  you  know  its  rude  not  to  become  immediately  attracted  to  and  fuck  some  guy  just  because  he's  psychologically  manipulating  you  by  pretending  to  be  your  friend... __label__0
Yeah  I  mean,  if  I  had  a  chance  to  play  with  one  of  the  best  players  of  all  time  (Lemieux)  again,  I  would  want  out  too. __label__1
cuz  east  needs  to  be  united,  because  we  could  see  last  years  that  their  lack  of  union  with  every  other  eastern  region  made  them  lose  every  international  event! __label__1
Maybe  he  was  having  visions  of  his  past  life  as  a  gladiator  in  the  arena  and  thought  the  pillow  fight  was  a  fight  to  the  death. __label__0
Yeah  he  clearly  didn't  have  tons  of  mental  problems  that  landed  him  in  psychiatric  care  nah  he  was  there  for  fun  it's  2016  come  on  guys __label__1
Well  of  course  he  said  that,  he  read  our  comments  on  the  other  thread  and  said  ,"  yea,  I  do  deserve  some  time  off  to  recover!" __label__0
