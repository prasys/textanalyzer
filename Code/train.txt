Should  use  the  same  logic  with  white  supremacists...  KKK  said  blacks  were  inferior  100  years  ago,  so  it  must  be  true  because  someone  said  it  before  now. __label__0
You  think  it's  bad  now,  as  I  recall  with  damage  3.0  they're  planning  a  max  mod  cap  period,  because  that's  going  to  help  people  be  flexible  I'm  sure. __label__0
But...  but...  the  title  of  the  article  is  anti-Hillary...  Doesn't  that  mean  auto-upvote  to  get  it  to  the  front  page  without  any  thought  or  reading  what-so-ever? __label__0
You're  right,  the  part  of  the  American  justice  system  that  manages  copy  right  is  also  the  same  people  who  deploy  the  army  and  handle  foreign  policy __label__0
Do  what  the  guy  in  front  of  me  did:  Put  chains  on  all  4  tires  of  your  all  wheel  drive  Sienna,  then  drive  17  in  a  45.... __label__0
The  same  thing  as  everyone  else  who  gets  a  gym  membership  for  the  first  time  -  decide  it's  too  much  work,  give  up  and  eat  some  chips __label__1
Obviously  the  coaches  saw  something  in  Gaudreau  and  put  him  on  the  first  line  to  boost  McDavid  since  he  didn't  get  a  single  point  last  night. __label__0
they  may  have  the  best  eduction,  but  they're  a  bunch  of  socialist  atheists,  so  what  does  it  matter  when  they  are  bunch  of  immoral,  baby-murdering,  Godless  sinners  ? __label__1
Then  obviously  he  should  be  fired  because  gays  don't  deserve  jobs  and  if  you're  paying  that  gay  then  you're  supporting  homosexuality  and  jesus  hates  you  for  that. __label__0
You  soloQ  fanboys  are  a  minority  as,  according  to  Lyte,  one  major  reddit  poll  made  it  clear  that  most  of  the  13  people  who  voted  didn't  want  it. __label__0
If  you  consider  that  blue  is  a  very  rare  color  for  cars,  and  almost  no  cars  are  blue,  this  is  very  strong  evidence  for  SA's  guilt. __label__1
But  bro  I  only  lost  because  my  team  sucks  and  the  game  sucks,  and  the  guns  suck,  and  there  were  hackers,  and  lag  comp  and  and  and  and.... __label__1
ADD,  acute  stress  disorder,  male  erectile  disorder,  hyper  sexuality,  narcissism,  premature  ejaculate  disorder,  dyslexia  -  all  perfectly  good  reasons  to  put  these  threats  to  society  on  this  list. __label__1
You're  right,  there's  something  wrong  with  every  Galaxy  Nexus  ever  made,  as  can  be  seen  by  every  GNex  owner  on  this  entire  subreddit  and  in  the  entire  world. __label__0
What  an  articulate  and  level  headed  answer,  by  someone  who  has  clearly  read,  assimilated  and  critically  thought  about  the  points  laid  out  in  front  of  him. __label__0
Let's  have  the  game  between  top  8  teams  at  S3  Worlds  be  worth  the  same  as  the  game  between  two  teams  who  were  1  game  away  from  relegation! __label__1
If  I  was  a  was  a  yoga  intstructer  or  star  bucks  barrista  and  then  magically  over  night  was  making  125k  a  year  I'd  support  her  too. __label__1
No,  he's  supposed  to  call  911  and  patiently  wait  for  an  officer  to  arrive,  while  some  random  thugs  beat  the  shit  out  of  him  and  run  away. __label__1
Oh  there  will  be,  thankfully  people  set  up  bots  to  buy  all  the  tickets  in  the  first  minute  and  let  actual  fans  pay  2-3x  the  price! __label__0
So,  it  is  quite  obvious  that  we  need  a  penile-transfer-union,  because  the  harmonisation  with  the  freedom  of  movement  is  clearly  not  working  and  is  a  failed  policy. __label__0
Well,  obviously  since  you  knew  *one*  kid  with  Asperger's  that  could  be  violent  at  times,  all  people  within  the  autism  spectrum  will  grow  up  to  commit  mass  murder. __label__0
But  their  outrage  goes  against  the  world  policy  of  we  are  all  ONE  people...teach  the  kids  young  and  now  before  we  become  more  separated  but  equal. __label__1
Thats  why  its  beeing  used  in  science..  coz  its  easy..  not  coz  its  more  accurate  ofcourse..  how  did  we  get  that  idea..  Scientists  always  want  the  easy  option.. __label__1
Oh  things  will  really  kick  off  when  they  start  talking  about  physics  optimisations  and  show  maybe  2  screenshots  of  Source  2  and  perhaps  some  footage  of  physics  simulation. __label__0
What  are  you  talking  about,  i  love  getting  bodied  by  a  tier  3  myers  after  i  get  matched  with  rank  20's  that  just  bought  the  game. __label__0
...  I  mean...  It's  not  like  it's  their  job  to  properly  count  and  hand  me  money  or  anything...  Or  that  a  5  year  old  could  do  it  properly... __label__0
the  comments  under  the  article  indicate  their  readership  consists  of  only  putinbots  or  the  british  are  not  falling  for  western  narrative..  it  has  to  be  putinbots __label__0
the  closer  you  get  to  the  center  of  the  "universe"  you  have  to  pay  more  ,  so  be  ready  only  rich  people  will  get  to  the  center __label__0
well  DE  did  increase  Oxium  output  by  10  times,  but  they  are  also  increasing  the  demand  by  the  same  order...  i  guess  this  is  called  "balanced". __label__0
Yep  that  will  make  them  feel  better  when  they  can  barely  pay  their  student  loans  for  their  four  year  degree  that  was  required  for  a  higher  skilled  job. __label__0
Yeah,  the  greatest  thing  about  Virtual  Reality  is  truly  realilty,  why  visit  magical  otherworldly  places  when  you  can  visit  places  you  could  have  seen  without  a  800$  headset __label__1
But  I  don't  need  to  prove  that  there  is  no  God,  because  you  can't  prove  that  there  is  one  so  that  makes  me  justified  in  my  assholish  comments __label__0
I'd  love  to  think  of  what  Britain  would  look  like  without  nuclear  weapons,  because  everyone  knows  that  MAD  was  a  complete  failure  of  a  policy  right __label__0
Oh  yeah,  the  current  ultra  strict  laws  that  don't  affect  criminals  are  not  working  so  the  obvious  answer  is  to  pass  stricter  laws  that  wont  affect  criminals. __label__1
If  the  console  is  only  rendering  3fps  then  the  game  will  look  10-20  times  better  than  it  would  at  60fps  because  it  has  more  time  to  render  it  better __label__1
I'm  sure  tons  of  companies  will  be  lining  up  to  invest  in  wind  and  solar  in  a  province  that  has  a  history  of  reneging  on  contracts __label__0
But  by  ridding  the  world  of  white  people,  they'd  actually  be  making  a  really  efficient  wish,  by  ridding  the  world  of  violence,  hate,  AND  racism  all  at  once. __label__1
Yeah  I'm  sure  this  will  happen,  just  like  people  kicked  me  from  groups  for  not  having  Blackwyrm  gems  or  not  having  Valentine  gem  on  all  my  characters. __label__0
Well,  after  looking  at  your  past  comments  and  the  subs  you  frequent,  I've  decided  that  your  position  on  this  subject  is  invalid  because  reasons  and  stuff. __label__0
We  men  don't  care  as  along  as  we  can  go  shoot  guns  in  the  army  and  get  kinky  sex  from  our  GFs  when  we  get  back  home. __label__1
And,  in  the  days  after  that,  there  will  also  be  a  complex,  nuanced  national  dialogue  of  the  solution  to  keeping  these  shootings  from  happening  again  free  of  political  bias. __label__0
When  a  dozen  of  them  become  criminals,  it  will  be  obvious  that  all  42k  should  be  rounded  up  and  deported,  straight  back  to  Syria  or  whatever. __label__1
Right,  because  in  a  free  world  you  are  only  permitted  the  same  rights  the  country  of  your  genetic  or  spiritual  heritage  allows  to  the  rest  of  the  world. __label__1
I  hate  to  be  that  person  but  because  you  are  from  the  US  then  you  are  ignorant  to  the  fact  that  spelt  is  far  superior  to  spelled __label__0
But  of  course  speed  has  nothing  to  do  with  this,  if  the  lambo  had  been  traveling  under  the  speed  of  light  the  mazda  should  have  seen  him  coming. __label__1
No  no,  it  has  to  do  with  other  Euro  countries  such  as  Germany  punishing  innocent  Greeks  by  asking  the  Greek  government  to  pay  back  its  debt  obligations. __label__0
Setting  aside  the  football  context  for  a  moment,  brilliant  idea  by  the  marketing  department  to  come  up  with  the  image  of  a  Muslim  smashing  up  a  tower  block. __label__0
Something  you  watch  for  enjoyment  v  something  that  has  to  be  scrutinised  for  fractures  or  other  abnormalities,  can't  see  why  one  uses  so  much  more  data __label__0
Can't  wait  for  that  cuck  Justin  Trudeau  to  appologise  to  the  islamists  for  the  blood  on  their  swords  they  had  to  clean  after  that  islamophobe  got  punished.... __label__0
But  it's  really  fast  on  the  4x4  matrices  I  tested  in  Matlab,  computers  are  so  fast  these  days  I  can't  imagine  you  would  ever  need  anything  else! __label__0
I'll  be  waiting  for  part  2  of  the  series  on  the  gender  gap  in  coal  miners,  and  part  3  on  the  gender  gap  in  homeless  populations  and  in  prisons. __label__0
No  way  man,  you  still  spoiled  it  -  by  having  to  read  your  title  without  seeing  a  spoiler  tag,  now  he  knows  that  the  game  has  endings. __label__0
Maybe  you  can  write  a  big  big  "Please  show  yourself  out"  on  a  picture  of  a  bleeding  heart  That  will  work  when  dealing  with  people  that  respect  PC __label__0
Yes,  you  were  so  poorly  behaved  from  being  cooped  up  as  punishment  I  will  force  you  to  stay  here  that  won't  backfire  on  me  at  all! __label__0
Ya'know,  besides  using  it  for  rushing,  shatters,  castle,  oryx,  wc,  tomb  bosses...  so  all  the  places  you  would  want  to  use  an  oreo  you  can  use  this! __label__0
Sure,  if  you  call  banning  abortion,  gay  marriage,  kill  national  healthcare,  free  college  tuition,  and  removing  money  from  politics  as  productive...then  Bernie  is  only  holding  this  country  back. __label__0
Don't  you  know  that  cause  he's  a  socialist  that  made  it  big  he  has  to  change  his  ideology  and  we  can't  listen  to  his  music  either? __label__0
Might  have  hit  like  1  or  2  old  ladies  along  the  way,  but  c'mon,  they  were  practically  asleep  on  the  crosswalk,  can't  say  they  didn't  have  it  coming. __label__1
Oh,  yeah,  going  on  and  on  about  how  he's  gonna  want  her  dick  so  bad  after  she  has  him  makes  a  WONDERFUL  impression  on  a  girl's  father. __label__0
Yeah  because  "I'll  send  you  $4  **for  shits  and  giggles**"  means  that  "Hey  I  want  that  thing  you  posted  about"  it  seem  like  common  sence  doesn't  it? __label__1
Oh  but  surely  given  the  entire  population  of  the  planet  and  the  many  years  the  internet  has  been  about  a  story  like  this  could  *never*  occur  right? __label__0
Yeah,  I'd  rather  be  in  the  poorer  class,  because  it's  better  to  have  no  money,  no  food,  no  education,  no  safety  and  no  hospitals  than  having  to  pay  taxes! __label__1
no  assad  is  an  angel  obv,  only  reason  syria  is  in  this  state  is  the  devil  coalition  against  him  ,  i  hope  the  good  guys  will  win __label__0
Fine,  we  will  keep  everyone  at  the  same  speed  of  internet,  but  that  means  everyone  has  to  sign  up  for  the  internet,  to  help  share  the  cost! __label__0
Difference  being  blacks  would  significantly  be  a  large  voting  block  or  union  leaders  of  blue  collar  workers,  while  the  gays  are  too  busy  being  fabulous  to  bother  voting. __label__0
dude  you  raise  valid  points  against  a  guy  maining  a  champ  that  does  dumb  shit  while  being  simple  as  fuck,  he's  gotta  defend  himself  with  whatever  means  possible __label__0
Well,  since  our  legal  system  is  built  on  the  acceptance  of  jailing  the  innocent  in  the  interested  of  also  jailing  the  guilty...  This  isn't  that  big  a  deal. __label__0
Hey  stop  being  racist  about  people  who  like  that  book,  hating  people  who  like  a  certain  book  and  do  one  yoga  exercise  out  of  it  everyday  is  racist __label__1
Easy,  I  would  tell  a  cop  I  am  scared  of  gun  dealing  black  markets  and  ask  him  what  areas  to  avoid  and  who  to  not  ask  for. __label__1
I  wasn't  aware  that  the  ability  to  speak  relatively  freely  was  resulting  in  nearly  as  many  deaths  down  in  the  States,  but  thanks  for  letting  me  know. __label__1
I'm  sure  their  kids  wouldn't  be  traumatized  at  all  by  the  sight  of  their  parent  beating  up  a  stranger  who  poses  no  real  threat  to  them. __label__0
Realistically,  I  believe  the  esoteric  assessments  that  such  feeble,  de-intricate  cognitive  complexes  presume  are  rather  astounding  in  an  entertaining  and  theological  form,  if  such  presumptions  could  be  crafted. __label__0
Burn  down  the  White  House,  declare  a  government  emergency  requiring  a  relocation  of  the  executive  branch  to  trump  tower  and  pay  for  operations  with  tax  payer  money! __label__1
...but  but  but  but  Facebook  told  me  that  there's  a  slave  ring  being  run  in  the  basement  of  a  pizza  parlor  that  doesn't  even  have  a  basement! __label__0
I  think  it's  a  great  idea  to  vote  for  a  guy  that  needs  to  constantly  reaffirm  that  his  hands  are  big  and  that  his  penis  is  great. __label__0
Yes,  the  fact  that  the  Bucs  got  penalized  16  times  is  evidence  that  the  refs  were  biased,  not  that  the  Bucs  committed  a  lot  of  penalties  that  game __label__0
Yeah  because  what  I  said  is  that  the  one  game  proves  NA  is  on  another  level  of  macro,  I  didn't  claim  it  as  evidence,  you're  right. __label__0
Wow,  I  am  so  glad  that  the  devs  are  prioritizing  another  biome  over  decent  MMO  mechanics,  a  better  UI,  or  a  fun  world  to  play  in! __label__0
I've  never  been  rich,  but  I'm  sure  never  having  to  work  a  minimum  wage  job  flipping  burgers  for  the  rest  of  my  life  would  be  a  terrible  terrible  thing. __label__1
"And  ive  always  wondered  about  unreported  date  rape  in  asia,  because  I  bet  you  it's  pretty  fucking  high"  LOL  because  that  NEVER  EVER  happens  in  Murica,  amirite? __label__0
Well  if  you  were  a  good  little  mind  reader  like  I  said  above  you  would  be  able  to  keep  up  with  the  changes  of  her  mind. __label__0
And  we  here  in  these  here  U  S  A  know  that  any  "mental  disorder"  can  be  right  fixed  by  tell  'em  to  cut  that  sheit  out! __label__0
Ah,  if  only  the  peons  could  shut  up  a  bit  and  have  the  *gravitas*  of  a  head  of  state  who  got  a  broom  stuck  up  his  arse. __label__0
Nah,  bullshit,  it  was  clearly  so  they  can  field  a  shitty  team  and  spend  less  monies  while  they  wait  for  their  stadium  to  be  built  in  LA. __label__1
It's  usually  at  this  point  you  should  have  thrown  up  double  devil  horns  on  each  hand,  yelled  "HAIL  SATAN  AND  EAT  BACON"  and  stormed  out  while  eating  a  baby. __label__1
Never  in  a  million  years  could  20  10  year  olds  all  fighting  with  pillows  cause  2  to  get  wayyy  too  into  it  and  beat  each  other  up. __label__1
Look  at  that  cute  cartoon  cow  -  I  shall  go  vegan  this  instant  and  go  stand  in  a  corner  and  think  about  what  a  bad,  bad  person  I've  been' __label__0
Tell  me  that  isn't  a  little  tempting  when  she's  railing  on  you  for  the  3rd  time  this  week  to  pick  up  your  clothes  and  put  the  seat  down. __label__1
One  assumes  from  your  comment  that  you  always  score  perfectly  in  your  video  games,  and  never  ever  make  mistakes  in  *the  simpler  environment*  of  real  life. __label__0
Yes  I  am  sure  they  save  a  lot  of  lives  and  don't  ever  do  anything  bad  that  negates  whatever  'savior'  complex  they  got  that  job  for. __label__0
This  sounds  like  a  great  plan,  and  then  when  the  school  buildings  are  crumbling  we  can  take  the  road  repair  funds  and  throw  them  at  the  schools! __label__0
Dayuuum,  I  might  have  to  head  over  to  the  Bernie  Sanders  camp..  That's  where  all  the  women  are  at..  Only  reason  why  I'd  vote  for  Bernie. __label__0
Tell  her  you're  relieved  to  know  that  not  inviting  your  sister  won't  affect  your  mum's  devotion  to  you  since  your  conduct  doesn't  matter  one  way  or  another. __label__0
Yeah  because  a  gay  rights  rally  has  people  running  around  having  sex  all  the  time,  because  people  being  gay  is  only  about  sexual  acts,  and  not  civil  rights. __label__1
NO  DUDE  MLK  WAS  PEACEFUL  AND  THIS  IS  SUPER  VIOLENT  TOWARDS  THE  POOR  IPAD  JUST  LOOK  AT  THE  CORD  WHERE  IT  PLUGS  IN  IT'S  BREAKING  INTO  TWO  PIECES. __label__0
I  agree,  and  that's  why  I  think  Mass  effect  3  is  just  as  good  as  the  first  2  and  Dead  Space  3  coop  was  the  best  idea  ever. __label__0
Don't  be  silly,  Jay  intercepted,  killed,  and  buried  Hae  while  using  Adnan's  phone  and  car,  and  hanging  out  with  Adnan  all  day,  and  Adnan  was  none  the  wiser. __label__0
because  the  person  who  is  collecting  is  no  where  near  as  qualified  as  me  to  play  the  game  and  they  are  getting  money  and  not  meeeeee. __label__1
Well  everyone  *knows*  computer  games  make  you  violent,  is  it  so  hard  to  believe  that  people  who  are  passionate  about  them  would  be  even  more  violent  than  that? __label__1
See  this  is  why  the  general  should  go  back  playing  in  the  LCS  he'd  make  a  great  shot  caller,  giving  the  opponents  the  least  amount  of  gold  possible __label__0
As  I  learned  from  reddit  we  are  collapsing  from  the  refugee  crisis  and  the  right  wing,  mainly  AFD,  will  win  the  next  election  by  a  landslide. __label__0
So  he  only  need  to  do  it  like  6  more  times  like  you  guys  made  Trump  disavow  the  KKK,  because  Sanders  didn't  *really*  disavow  correctly  the  first  time. __label__0
They  obviously  aren't  allowed  to  assemble,  because  the  assembly  is  for  the  purpose  of  spreading  hate  and  racism,  and  they  were  going  to  incite  violence  anyway! __label__1
Well  this  is  just  outrageous,  You  little  Brats  need  to  be  tied  down  and  force  fed  your  fruit  and  veggies,  or  else  you  will  be  obese  and  ugly..... __label__1
Indeed;  why  waste  time  having  actual  conversations  with  people  when  it's  so  much  easier  to  just  call  them  stupid  trolls  and  run  away  and  declare  yourself  the  victor? __label__0
I'm  sure  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  fact  that  two  of  the  most  influential  members  of  the  committee  are  former  coaches  of  Big  10  teams. __label__0
But  my  tattoo  is  on  my  right  ribs  and  when  I  look  in  the  mirror  it's  still  on  my  mirror's  right  ribs  from  my  point  of  view. __label__1
Yes,  I  can  see  how  it's  logical  that  I'm  responsible  for  every  child's  death  for  even  -thinking-  about  the  issue  for  the  children  I  -don't-  have  yet. __label__1
If  we  just  let  women  go  around  doing  what  they  want,  then  they  might  trick  us  into  doing  something  bad  again  and  god  might  put  more  curses  on  us! __label__0
Because  he's  not  played  so  much  anymore  I  remember  the  time  when  he  was  played  in  competitive  and  he'd  just  oneshot  people  straight  from  100-0  good  champ  imo. __label__0
Well  they  can't  tell  you  what  he's  done  or  will  do  because  that  would  be  of  national  security,  but  one  can  trust  they  are  doing  a  fine  job. __label__0
"I  mean,  he  was  burned  so  badly,  it  was  down  to  his  flesh,"  said  McCrea  This  lady  sounds  like  she  knows  what  she  is  talking  about __label__0
Worked  for  the  banks  though  hey  ,  i  mean  why  help  the  normal  ppl  when  you  can  pay  some  bad  bets  off  for  a  chum  from  eton. __label__0
even  if  the  source  was  100%  unbiased,  half  the  redditors  would  never  believe  it,  because  as  we  all  know,  if  you  got  arrested  and  beat  you  totally  deserved  it. __label__0
Because  your  rights  are  getting  in  the  way  of  my  profits,  now  go  out  there  and  suffer  massive  internal  damages  for  my  amusement  and  shut  the  hell  up! __label__1
yeah  fuck  you  for  trying  to  have  an  honest  and  real  discussion  and  not  making  another  joke  don't  you  realize  this  is  a  thread  about  the  Kings? __label__0
Yeah  but  the  Tories  helping  the  poor  is  like  when  billionaires  donate  to  charity,  they  aren't  doing  it  because  they  care  they're  doing  it  for  the  tax  relief. __label__0
Sounds  to  me  like  your  DM  is  just  too  lazy  to  take  charge  of  all  the  NPCs  so  he  just  shoves  the  job  onto  you  guys. __label__0
Can  I  just  pickup  my  SE  pre-order  from  Best  Buy,  drive  to  GameStop,  claim  to  them  that  I  didn't  get  key  chains  with  my  SE,  and  profit? __label__1
Yeah,  I'm  sure  that  no  vets  will  take  less  money  to  go  to  a  73  win  team  that  just  added  a  league  MVP  to  their  roster. __label__0
In  addition:  Because  everybody  (even  the  government)  drinks  alcohol  it  isn't  a  problem  with  that  as  they  know  how  it  works  and  can  still  make  accurate  predictions __label__0
Clearly  the  answer  is  for  all  the  people  who'd  be  hit  hardest  by  this  is  to  eat  healthier,  tighten  your  belt  and  pull  yourself  up  by  your  bootstraps __label__1
Yeah..  making  your  own  rating  agencies  with  political  agendas  and  a  clear  bias  against  investment  advice  that's  worked  more  often  than  not..  that'll  work  well  in  pulling  investors. __label__0
I  was  just  going  to  say:  The  game  needs  to  be  patched,  so  there  is  a  recall  so  Nintendo  can  put  out  the  patched  version  of  the  game. __label__1
Yeah,  it's  much  more  likely  that  a  bunch  of  experienced  outdoorsmen  all  somehow  caught  hypothermia  as  opposed  to  have  encountered  a  violent  wild  animal  in  the  wilderness  of  Russia. __label__1
I  SAW  6  VINES  AND  ONLY  14  PEDESTRIANS  AND  12  CARS,  THIS  GAME  IS  SHIT  AND  I  WILL  NEVER  BUY  IT  YOU  ARE  ALL  SUCKERS  AND  IDIOTS  JBDFGUIAEHBNROGUINSDJKACFNVL __label__0
Yeah  taking  away  a  character's  story  and  making  him  sexually  obsessed  with  pickles  is  totally  not  the  work  of  a  fucking  moron  nope  not  at  all __label__0
Nice,  i  love  it  when  the  german  scene  gives  their  talents  some  place  to  prove  themselves  instead  of  taking  some  old  players  that  already  reached  their  peak __label__0
babe  i  love  you  but  could  you  please  get  a  boob  job,  I'm  just  offering  a  solution  because  I  don't  wanna  break  up  over  a  shallow  problem __label__0
Because  those  people  that  dislike  this  change  are  just  having  a  knee-jerk  reaction,  not  the  fact  that  this  change  is  detrimental  to  the  functionality  of  the  site. __label__0
But  guys...  He's  a  poor  shooter  so  nobody's  defending  him  on  those  half-court  possessions,  that's  why  he  has  space  to  pass  the  ball  to  the  open  man! __label__0
Oh  yeah,  because  the  Republican  Party  is  the  one  with  the  most  embedded  racism,  and  tend  to  feel  a  little  extreme  when  Trump  speaks  his  mind. __label__1
Yeah,  what  an  idiot,  getting  a  tattoo  of  something  he  may  potential  love,  something  that  might  have  changed  his  life,  something  that  might  make  him  happy,  fuck  this  guy! __label__1
Yeah  why  spend  money  on  a  coherent  story,  more  content,  and  more  customization  when  you  can  spend  millions  on  voice  actors  to  say  "What  would  it  be,  Guardian?" __label__0
no  way..  I  thought  a  saltire  is  a  heraldic  symbol  in  the  form  of  a  diagonal  cross,  like  the  shape  of  the  letter  X  in  Roman  type. __label__1
I'm  sure  the  farmer  pays  them  quite  generously  that  even  other  American  like  you  or  I,  would  be  willing  to  work  for  such  a  nice  way  of  life. __label__0
Don't  worry  I'm  sure  DPS  will  levy  appropriate  disciplinary  measures  on  Bennett,  as  they  are  obviously  very  serious  and  committed  to  protecting  players  from  head  injuries. __label__0
Yeah  ok  if  the  video  starts  with  some  immature  kids  imitating  fapping  sounds  with  their  mouths,  you  know  this  is  gonna  be  excellent  entertainment  and  totally  worth  your  time. __label__0
Yes  but  if  we  have  more  babies,  there  will  be  more  people,  and  the  more  people  we  have,  the  more  people  can  choose  to  not  have  babies! __label__1
But  the  clg  rookies  have  peaked  and  tsm  are  the  better  team  and  clg  got  lucky  and  can  only  play  split  push  and  are  completely  one  dimensional. __label__0
Yes  as  you  can  see  this  isn't  in  korea  and  the  o  in  apdo  has  a  little  apostrophe  on  it  so  we  know  this  can't  be  apdo __label__0
But  the  only  way  to  achieve  meaningful  gender  equality  is  by  enabling  men  to  be  able  to  fuck  whoever  they  want,  whenever  they  want,  just  like  women  can! __label__1
Wait  a  minute...  The  4  Trail  Captains  +  Lillie  =  5...  Garnet  +  Amethyst  +  Pearl  +  Peridot  +  Lapis  =  5...  IT  ALL  COMES  TOGETHER... __label__1
Well  you  try  standing  on  a  raised  platform  in  a  cold  room  wearing  a  telly  tubby  mask  and  tell  me  how  big  you  dick  is  then. __label__0
Well,  considering  that  bitcoin  is  a  CIA  project  and  they  already  have  all  of  Satoshi's  stash,  I'd  say  no  because  they  already  have  5%  of  all  possible  coins. __label__1
This  game  showed  that  they  can  hang  in  there  and  scrape  out  the  win  in  a  close  game,  id  probably  move  them  up  to  2  tbh. __label__0
Nah,  best  to  take  all  morals  and  previous  learning  out  of  the  picture  and  let  rapists  free  because  a  piece  of  paper  says  we  are  supposed  to. __label__0
But  but  but,  the  prisoners  deserve  to  be  used  because  they  did  crime,  plus  they  get  paid  like  25  cents  a  day  so  it  isn't  slavery __label__1
Because  they  are  getting  a  better  deal  than  me  in  my  job,  therefore  I  begrudge  them  plus  I  had  to  catch  a  bus  instead  of  a  train  today __label__1
Because  madlife  predicting  exactly  where  people  would  flash  in  order  to  land  a  hook  was  clearly  thresh  being  op  and  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  player __label__0
The  average  redditor  probably  wouldn't  date  me  because  I'm  a  woman  over  24  and  we  all  know  that's  when  women  become  living  Roombas  with  no  sex  appeal __label__0
Yeah,  don't  talk  about  it  with  other  people  who  might  be  able  to  share  some  insight  so  you  know  what  to  talk  to  your  doctor  about  exactly. __label__0
Yeah  you  are  right,  I  suggest  we  start  nuking  the  sun  so  we  can  start  the  process  of  it  going  super  nova,  it's  all  pointless  anyway. __label__0
The  best  part  is,  Regi  was  the  guy  that  DL  needed,  a  strong  man  that  can  hold  him  down  and  make  him  happy  at  the  same  time __label__1
Fuck  I've  been  gaming  at  1440p  on  a  gtx780  for  three  years  now,  no  one  ever  filled  me  in  on  it  not  being  a  1440p  card... __label__1
Because  obviously  the  first  picture  is  literally  the  moment  before  the  blast  and  there's  no  way  they  could  have  been  in  different  positions  when  it  actually  went  off. __label__1
The  most  ironical  thing:  The  decision  of  whether  to  'keep'  the  tiger  or  'let  it  go'  will  drag  on  the  files  for  years  -  may  be  decades. __label__1
Marijuana  killed  2  people  in  the  history  of  the  world  and  it  happened  when  marijuana  is  starting  to  become  legal  stop  it  now  befive  it's  too  late __label__1
Why  would  I  do  that  when  the  optimal  way  to  farm  karma  is  to  flipflop  my  view  based  on  what  the  majority  in  a  thread  are  saying? __label__1
yeah,  they  also  didnt  know  what  germs  were  and  probably  defecated  in  holes,  but  supposedly  lived  5-10s  longer  than  us,  probably  all  the  "chemicals"  in  our  food __label__1
Yeah,  it's  not  like  we  actually  use  the  roads  or  public  schools  or  national  defense  or  any  of  the  other  hundred  things  our  tax  money  goes  toward. __label__1
Well  I  mean  they  had  like  3  or  4  seconds  to  analyze  before  the  shock  wave  destroyed  their  house  so  that  should  be  plenty  of  time! __label__1
If  I  only  have  Wi-Fi,  can  I  file  a  complaint  with  the  United  Nations  to  get  mobile  data  so  I  can  play  as  a  human  right? __label__0
Yes  but  next  year  is  the  Mayan  end-of-the-world  (really  just  the  end  of  a  cycle)  so  of  course  we  have  to  end  it  on  a  Christian  schedule __label__1
Because  if  someone  has  more  stuff  in  a  video  game  than  you,  it  must  be  because  you're  better  than  them  and  they  have  no  life  right? __label__0
Dana  is  a  piece  of  shit,  he  is  bad  for  the  sport  and  the  only  reason  he  gave  them  the  money  is  because  it  was  being  filmed. __label__0
Well  I'm  just  really  concerned  that  there  might  be  some  rancid  xenophobia  in  there  that  you're  not  admitting  and  we  can't  have  there  in  my  city. __label__0
When  the  police  get  there,  be  sure  to  yell  "GUN"  repeatedly  and  loudly,  and  wave  your  gun  around  so  they  know  it's  you  who  is  armed. __label__0
Not  to  mention  that  SAO  is  the  best  one  out  there  and  Kirito  is  the  real  black  swordsman,  not  the  other  lame  guy,  what  was  his  name,  Bowels? __label__0
Nah,  there  must  be  100%  freedom  for  every  option  in  the  game  but  the  game  still  has  to  work  100%  well  and  it's  PGI's  fault  if  it  doesn't. __label__1
Yeah,  but  random  redditors  says  that  it  runs  fine  on  their  Intel  HD2000,  so  really  I  think  they  are  just  butthurt  for  not  being  good  with  PC  gaming. __label__0
DUDE  YOU  CAN'T  JUST  GO  AND  TRY  TO  GET  PEOPLE  TO  PLAY  A  FUN  GAME  ON  A  PUBLIC  SETTING,  DO  YOU  WANT  TO  GET  BANNED  FROM  SCHOOL  TOO __label__0
Yeah,  let's  kick  him  out  for  a  guy  in  who's  going  to  bend  to  your  displeasure  and  go  back  to  not  adequately  funding  the  pension  system. __label__0
Because  cops  mistakes  are  only  done  with  malice  and  they  could  never  have  good  intentions  and  doctors  mistakes  are  only  unfortunate  accidents  and  never  due  to  malice  or  incompetence. __label__0
Yeah,  it  says  we  get  no  freedom  and  the  big  bad  government  is  going  to  spy  on  the  porn  that  we  watch  and  tell  our  mommies! __label__1
Damn  dude  you  should  publish  your  research  and  send  it  over  to  PBS  and  BBC,  let  them  know  that  you  figured  out  that  they're  all  wasting  their  time. __label__0
Oh  look  the  same  3  guys  we  see  now  all  acting  the  same  way  HAHA  SO  GOOD  but  they  only  got  better  so  now  they  all  suck. __label__1
Mass  child  rape  cases  and  cousins  marrying  as  a  statistic  will  always  track  I  suspect  but  don't  ever  raise  the  question  of  Islam  involvement  you  racist! __label__0
outsourcing  made  America  great  because  it  allowed  for  a  few  American  ceos  to  get  richer  because  americans  weren't  hard  enough  workers  and  didn't  know  how  to  suck  it  up. __label__0
ya,  kid  totally  deserves  jail..  that  or  maybe  just  cut  out  the  middle  man  and  let  a  cop  shoot  him  for  fear  of  being  run  over. __label__0
wasting  game  after  game  of  your  time  getting  stomped  on  is  actually  something  you  should  be  thankful  for,  because  playing  against  better  players  helps  you  improve  your  own  skill! __label__0
Being  too  tin,  it's  obvious  to  me  that  the  pro  obesity  moment  is  doing  good  work  on  combating  this  misogyny  but  some  people  are  just  too  dense __label__0
I  hate  it  when  companies  with  whom  I  have  an  existing  business  relationship  notify  me  when  I  am  using  their  service  of  other  aspects  of  their  service. __label__0
Cheering  is  the  uttering  or  making  of  sounds  encouraging,  stimulating  or  exciting  to  action,  indicating  approval  or  acclaiming  or  welcoming  persons,  announcements  of  events  and  the  like. __label__1
"most  talented  surgeons  are  total  cunts"  Yeah  dude  I  can  tell  you  definitely  have  your  facts  straight  and  that  you  make  generalizations  that  aren't  full  of  shit. __label__0
It's  ok  though,  only  the  government  will  have  access  to  the  security  backdoors,  just  like  those  tsa  keys  for  baggage  that  totally  aren't  available  to  3d  print  now. __label__0
"I'm  comfortable  filling  the  most  glaring  hole  in  my  team  with  the  player  that  a  vast  majority  of  scouts  consider  the  best"  I  never  would  have  guessed __label__0
If  they  want  a  good  education  then  their  parents  shouldn't  have  made  bad  life  choices,  maybe  they  should  get  a  job  and  pay  for  their  own  socialistic  education. __label__1
Yeah,  because  NB  and  NS  both  need  another  50,000  poor  people  on  their  dime  so  that  people  in  Ontario  have  a  convenient  place  to  vacation  down  south. __label__0
We  didnt  even  get  hair  spiking  up  when  we  go  super  saiyan  lol,  asking  for  mid  fight  fusion  is  far  beyond  the  capabilities  of  our  current  tech __label__0
Guess  that  explains  why  when  I  log  on  every  zone  in  the  game  is  a  ghost  town  and  the  main  campaign  is  always  empty  in  prime  time __label__1
I  don't  know,  if  he  drives  a  car  the  way  he  rides  a  bike,  I  think  I'd  rather  he  use  the  vehicle  that  causes  less  damage  to  other  people. __label__0
The  funny  thing  is  that  if  we  were  just  a  mile  closer  to  or  further  from  the  sun,  Earth  would  be  nothing  but  a  barren  wasteland. __label__1
I  suppose  they'd  also  like  to  go  back  to  the  dark  ages  where  everything  was  done  by  candle  light,  cause  you  know  science  shouldn't  even  be  a  thing. __label__0
Isn't  that  the  whole  point  of  Canada  aside  from  the  healthcare  and  me  helping  you  build  a  wall  to  keep  my  Trump-supporting  aunt  from  ruining  it? __label__0
Yes,  "international  thinkers,  government  advisors  and  Wall  Street  money-men"  are  exactly  who  I  expect  to  come  up  with  a  good  plan  for  "a  moral  and  just  society" __label__0
He's  saying  if  you  put  an  inordinate  amount  of  time  and  effort  building  something  you're  passionate  about  it  doesn't  make  you  cool,  just  a  try  hard. __label__0
all  you  mechanics  are  freakin  scammers,  you  could  have  just  given  him  a  tire  rotation  and  he  could  have  gotten  a  lot  more  ~~tread~~  skid  life  out  of  those. __label__0
How  can  we  claim  to  be  a  free  country  when  you  can't  even  stab  someone  and  then  refuse  to  submit  to  the  police  who  come  to  arrest  you? __label__0
I  went  from  playing  3  matches  every  day  to  about  1  every  3-4  day  so  yes,  they  dit  it,  the  length  of  matches  went  really  down... __label__1
While  we  are  removing  items  we  might  as  well  remove  anything  that  makes  champions  do  damage,  because  having  items  that  make  you  stronger  is  just  broken. __label__0
Yes  fire  the  whole  staff  and  cancel  the  season  for  the  rest  of  the  season  because  what  could  be  a  14  year  old  maybe  a  stupid  mistake. __label__1
Cause  if  I  were  going  to  pick  one  candidate  to  shoot  harambe  and  one  to  protect  him,  this  is  exactly  the  way  I  would  see  it  playing  out. __label__0
OP  said  he  doesn't  like  double  barrelled  names  because  they're  'complicated',  Unlike  marriages,  which  are  all  smooth  and  easy  sailing  where  you  never  have  to  make  compromises __label__0
Yeah,  it  really  is  ridiculous  how  seahawk  fans  might  be  a  little  over  the  top  in  their  praise  for  Russell  when  they're  in  their  own  sub.... __label__1
Yeah  with  980  ti  sli  if  you  don't  have  a  144hz  monitor  you're  fucked,  you'll  be  burning  through  a  monitor  a  week  easy  at  only  100hz __label__0
When  I  look  at  my  children,  I  can't  wait  to  become  a  god  and  sacrifice  one  of  them  to  try  and  save  a  few  of  the  others. __label__1
Which  is  why  you  should  drive  as  fast  as  possible  when  drunk,  to  sober  up  from  the  rush  and  be  on  the  road  for  a  shorter  time! __label__0
Thanks,  now  I  know  to  stay  away  from  cone  snails  and  bullet  ants  the  next  time  I'm  hiking  through  the  rain  forest  on  my  way  to  go  scuba  diving. __label__1
Not  if  she  irrationally  got  upset  because  they  withheld  SO  MUCH  MONEY  then  celebrated  when  she  got  a  fat  refund  check  from  the  government  around  tax  time. __label__0
Yeah,  because  all  women  who  want  children  are  crazy  bitches  who  try  to  lure  in  an  innocent  guy  who  doesn't  want  children  by  getting  pregnant  behind  his  back... __label__0
Well  that  makes  perfect  sense,  I  mean  chosen  by  god  means  they  have  the  most  upstanding  morals,  so  they  should  be  allowed  to  steal  from  heathens  all  they  want __label__0
That's  not  true,  I  once  saw  a  bunch  of  people  post  fb  statuses  about  how  they  didnt  allow  fb  to  use  their  info  in  whatever  manner __label__0
Yeah,  the  Palestinians  don't  fall  under  the  enemies  we're  supposed  to  love  or  the  least  of  these  or  those  who  are  naked,  poor,  unclothed,  sick,  or  in  prison. __label__1
I'm  officially  if  the  j  rob  bandwagon...  Fuckin  idiot  this  will  be  fun  to  deal  with  for  the  next  decade...  Cool  though  we  got  some  lineman __label__1
This  kind  of  makes  sense..  I  don't  know  if  stopping  a  bad  guy  is  a  good  idea  though....  having  some  sort  of  defense  mechanism  might  be  too  manly. __label__1
Uh,  no,  bro,  we  have  to  throw  a  fit  about  it  and  block  them  even  if  it  makes  them  wreck  because  road  rage  affects  everyone  but  me. __label__0
Sorry  some  people  don't  know  some  matchups  because  they  haven't  been  playing  that  long,  I  guess  you  shouldn't  be  allowed  to  comment  if  you're  a  new  player __label__0
Because  nobody  genuinely  likes  webpages  and  the  deals  posted  by  them  and  wishes  to  recommend  others  to  go  there,  only  doing  so  when  they  themselves  are  paid. __label__1
Of  course,  just  like  Ant-Man  and  Guardians  of  the  Galaxy,  this  will  prove  once  again  that  audiences  only  watch  the  MCU  for  RDJ  and  Chris  Evans/Hemsworth. __label__1
Er...  Well  TECHNICALLY  MY  POST  THAT  WAS  DOWNVOTED  TO  HELL  WAS  AN  AU  CALLED  UNDERFAIL  AND  THAT  MEANS  THIS  GOES  AGAINST  COPYRIGHT  AND  YOU  SUCK  AND  MEEEH __label__1
Wow...way  to  put  forth  a  unbiased  opinion,  and  to  leave  out  key  parts  of  the  research...  Great  article  that  doesn't  mention  any  of  the  products  tested  in  the  research __label__0
As  a  16  year  old  I  will  have  you  know  I  am  actually  in  college  and  I  have  an  IQ  of  267  and  4  Masters  Degrees... __label__0
Hunting  over  bait  -  because  it  takes  a  lot  of  skill  to  wait  for  the  deer  to  walk  into  the  crosshairs  before  you  pull  the  trigger. __label__0
Sure  and  of  course  all  victim  blaming  occurs  only  by  males,  is  entirely  the  norm  and  therefore  it's  entirely  appropriate  to  use  wholesale  misandry  to  point  that  out. __label__1
because  "men"  who  have  sex  with  thin  women  are  actually  pedophiles  something  something  real  men  are  into  real  women  something  something  meat  on  their  bones  something  something __label__1
Don't  you  know  that  the  poor  immigrants  deserve  to  go  to  school  and  if  the  school  denies  them  then  they  need  to  check  their  white  privilege? __label__0
Yes  when  I  hear  free  open  opinion  the  first  thing  I  want  is  for  it  to  be  stifled  and  hidden  under  a  rock  not  being  heard  anywhere. __label__0
If  you  can't  explain  the  difference  between  a  fixed-rate  and  adjustable  rate  mortgage  to  a  4  year  old,  you're  clearly  a  terrible  parent  and  should  have  been  sterilized. __label__1
Lucky  you  :&lt;  Apparently  it's  meant  to  make  the  woman  want  to  seek  your  approval,  because  as  we  all  know  what  all  women  really  want  most  is  male  approval __label__0
Educate  yourself  shitlord,  black  people  never  do  anything  wrong  ever,  and  when  black  people  are  seen  committing  crimes,  it's  always  just  a  white  person  in  black  face. __label__0
I  don't  know  about  you,  but  when  I  want  my  car  back  in  an  hour  I'll  wait  *at  least*  a  week  before  I  text  the  person  again. __label__0
Reddit  is  a  hub  of  people  from  all  ages  and  ranges  of  smarts,  therefore  it  would  be  wise  to  ask  reddit  before  most,  if  not  all  real  life  decisions! __label__0
Man  why  does  the  south  have  such  a  hate  against  people  who  shit  on  them  and  call  them  scum  man  I  just  can't  figure  it  out __label__1
And  the  Government  will  for  sure  put  out  the  gathered  data  for  everyone  to  see  if  it  shows  that  different  groups  of  people  have  different  IQ. __label__0
You  mean  people  who  don't  take  care  for  their  health  are  also  more  likely  to  not  take  care  of  their  teeth,  I  would  have  never  guessed. __label__0
Right,  because  protests  that  had  hundreds  of  thousands  to  millions  of  people  involved  are  the  same  as  the  current  protest  of  20,000  pissed  off  college  students  nation  wide __label__1
I'm  sure  that  1-2  degree  difference  in  50  years  will  be  the  death  of  us  all  and  humanity  wont  be  able  to  use  technology  to  cope __label__1
Luckily  the  American  education  system  resolves  that  problem  so  the  average  American  is  knowledgable  about  the  rest  of  the  world  with  its  vastly  ranging  cultures,  languages  and  idiosyncrasies. __label__0
Yup,  because  it's  not  possible  that  people  who  have  been  together  long  enough  to  decide  to  get  married  could  possibly  be  in  agreement  about  children,  or  lack  thereof. __label__1
Iove  hearing  people  say  "there's  always  a  job  opening  at  McDonald's"  Motherfucker,  I  know  there's  a  job  there  but  I'd  rather  be  a  piece  of  shit. __label__0
not  really,  he  wrote  something(not  to  big)  back  in  the  early  70s,  when  he  was  not  busy  helping  the  civil  rights  movement  in  Chicago  i  mean,  you  forgot  the __label__0
Ah,  so  the  obvious  choice  to  reform  into  a  communist  nation,  where  things  like  crime  do  not  exist  and  therefore  the  need  of  police  is  obviated. __label__0
It  will  be  sensible,  and  it  will  be  British  and  much  better  than  what  Johnny  Foreigner  has  to  offer...  you  can  almost  hear  Elgar  playing  in  the  background __label__0
you  have  to  add  the  noise  from  a  old  style  reel  to  reel  movie  projector  as  well  as  simulating  film  and  splicing  artifacts  for  the  full  cinematic  experience. __label__0

Yes,  much  less  safe  to  have  the  license  plate,  times/route,  and  picture  of  every  driver  you  have  on  Uber  than  to  have  a  random  taxi  driver...especially  while  drunk! __label__0
Ya,  I  don't  know  I  was  thinking  about  getting  a  6P  but  then  I  read  about  these  knee  jerk  reactions,  and  now  I  am  not  sure  anymore. __label__0
uhhh  yeah  bro  fucken  pussies  its  almost  like  they  dont  want  some  guy  with  their  dick  out  next  to  them  its  like  nut  the  fuck  up  bro __label__0
Well  the  Loss  Protection  guy  is  clearly  a  lawyer  with  quotes  like  "I'm  not  a  cop,  you  can't  record  me,"  so  camera  guy  has  no  chance. __label__0
Damn,  fucking  Hai  can't  see  the  future  and  predict  that  he  will  have  to  play  again  even  tho  he  doesn't  want  to  because  meteos  is  stepping  down. __label__1
WOW  HE  LOOKS  SO  SMALL,  IS  HE  GOING  FOR  205,  HOLD  ON  LET  ME  MAKE  A  NEW  POST  -  said  a  bunch  of  retards  the  last  few  days __label__1

Bruh,  don't  you  know  that  each  grain  of  rice  left  in  your  bowl  equates  to  how  many  pockmarks  your  future  SO  will  have  and  have  ugly  they'll  be? __label__1
It's  the  lack  of  oxygen  in  your  system  due  to  having  small  lungs,  unlike  me,  because  you're  tiny  (and  I'm  big)  that  causes  drowning  not  the  water. __label__0
Yeah  the  fairy  music  of  the  original  Japanese  dub  in  a  scene  where  Goku  turns  Super  Saiyan  for  the  first  time  completely  makes  the  scene  in  the  originals. __label__1
For  $60,  it  would've  been  nice  if  they  had  made  it  out  of  titanium  with  at  least  a  fully  functional  Geiger  counter  and  radio  and  nuclear  fusion  power  source. __label__1
It's  crazy,  it's  almost  like  50  packs  is  too  small  a  sample  size  to  judge  when  the  odds  of  pulling  one  specific  card  is  sub  1%! __label__0
But  the  BJP  needs  to  put  up  winnable  candidates  to  save  the  Hindus  in  this  country.These  candidates  are  victims  of  vendetta  politics.False  cases  have  been  filed  against  them. __label__0
I  really  wouldn't  compare  a  papal  blessing  to  that  of  Peter  Popoff,  see  with  a  papal  blessing  you  get  a  piece  of  paper  back  for  your  money! __label__0
You  must  all  be  feminazi  scum  for  having  the  audacity  to  not  look  like  a  Hollywood  star  while  submitting  to  the  will  of  these  alleged  men. __label__1
Women  use  Condoms  on  there  sex  toys  sometimes  or  make  DIY  toys  with  them  either  that  or  she  getting  banged...  but  at  least  she  is  being  safe __label__0
You're  right,  because  the  action  is  point  and  click  the  game  obviously  has  nothing  to  do  with  Mass  Effect  in  terms  of  story,  character  developments  and  branching  paths. __label__0
Hold  on,  be  right  back  as  I  convert  an  old  Dell  Dimension  4300  case  to  hold  brand  new  hardware  so  I  can  get  delicious  karma  points  too. __label__1
seriously  its  like  don't  ever  ask  for  help  or  you're  immediately  branded  a  criminal,  I  mean  I  am  a  career  criminal  but  come  on  guys  lets  not  make  assumptions __label__0
Yeah,  i  could  imagine  seeing  nintendo  be  like  "  well,  most  of  all  trailers  and  screenshots  were  from  wii  u  but  we  cancelled  it  ok  bye!  " __label__0
Which  is  *soooo*  great  when  the  other  team  gets  all  the  precision  weapons  and  you  cant  apply  any  pressure  since  you  cant  even  get  close  and  stay  alive. __label__0
Nah  bro,  according  to  CNN  the  race  is  over  and  this  will  dominate  the  news  coverage  for  the  next  month  and  it  shows  Donald  isnt  sympathetic  duh __label__1
Shhhhh  no  we  care  about  the  principal  of  states  rights  just  trust  us  :)  stop  asking  us  what  we  want  to  use  them  for  because  it's  irrelevant! __label__1
As  someone  with  the  first  name  of  Daniel,  I  object  and  state  that  Urban  Dictionary  is  a  shining  beacon  of  academic  integrity,  one  of  which  dispenses  unparallelled  wisdom. __label__0
Hey  he  made  him  pinky  swear  he  was  a  good  guy  with  a  gun  not  a  bad  guy  with  a  gun  so  its  all  good  right? __label__0
YEA  LIKE  WHEN  I  PRAYED  THAT  I  WOULDNT  GET  RAPED  THEN  WALKED  IN  A  SHADY  NEIGHBORHOOD  BUT  THEN  AFTER  SOMEONE  RAPED  ME,  THEY  DIDN"T  RAPE  ME  AGAIN! __label__1
Well,  their  network  is  one  small  part  of  the  Internet,  so  taking  it  offline  technically  is  breaking  the  Internet  into  two  pieces  -  their  piece,  and  the  rest. __label__1
Yes,  go  ahead  and  stop  taking  the  meds  you  need  to  function  because  some  strangers  on  the  Internet  who  have  no  medical  knowledge  or  training  said  you  should. __label__0
you'd  think  that  someone  who  has  done  really  well  as  a  pacman  main  would  have  a  good  understanding  of  how  his  character  ranks  among  the  rest  no? __label__0
But  how  the  hell  do  you  expect  me  to  feel  better  about  my  own  insecurities  if  I  can't  make  fun  of  this  lady  hiding  behind  a  keyboard? __label__0
Yeah  I  should  be  able  to  send  a  videos  of  myself  dancing  half-naked  to  strangers,  but  if  they  show  it  to  any  other  strangers,  that's  wrong. __label__0
Ahh  yes,  the  people  who  don't  want  to  have  kids  or  cannot  take  care  of  them  suddenly  keeping  their  kids  will  be  great  for  society  long  term. __label__1
I  too  hope  that  this  body  isn't  Jessica  Ridgeway  and  instead  belongs  to  some  less  photogenic  kid,  preferably  a  minority  since  we  don't  really  care  about  them. __label__1
nah,  that's  okay,  the  same  thing  happened  in  bethlehem  in  0ad,  and  nobody  wrote  about  that,  so  we  know  it's  such  a  common  occurence  that  it  doesn't  bear  mentioning. __label__0
But  there  is  one  guy  that  works  at  NASA  that  refutes  Climate  Change  and  another  science  guy  someone  told  me  about,  so  check  mate  chicken  littles! __label__1
Yeah,  cause  people  are  insulting  you  by  literally  calling  you  a  baked  wheat  snack  when  they  say  "cracker",  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  race  or  ethnicity. __label__0
I  think  we  should  make  a  special  subreddit  for  these  so  we  have  a  dedicated  place  where  we  can  discuss  and  analyse  every  one  of  Luca's  tweets. __label__1
I  agree,  we  should  make  them  extra  skinny  with  nice  soft  lives  out  on  the  pasture  that  way  we  can  just  kill  way  more  of  them  instead. __label__1
yeah  Im  sure  you  had  the  exact  same  high  school  experience  as  every  other  teenage  and  no  one  else's  viewpoint  is  valid  because  you  know  everything __label__0
yeah,  cat  scratch  fever  is  just  such  a  great  song  and  totally  makes  up  for  the  batshit  crazy  inflammatory  bullshit  that  comes  out  of  his  mouth  now. __label__0
I'll  have  you  know  I  got  a  splinter  in  my  thumb,  and  I  only  cried  for  2  days  straight  as  I  tried  to  pull  it  out. __label__1
Here's  a  little  secret  on  how  to  make  LOTS  AND  LOTS  of  $$$$$  [Hold  down  the  Shift  key  and  press  4  LOTS  AND  LOTS  of  times] __label__1
Are  you  sure  he's  not  related  to  4  out  of  7  of  the  beach  boys  after  initially  being  related  to  1  out  of  the  first  4? __label__0
It  is  because  obviously  PSNow  is  a  conspiracy  to  force  us  to  continuously  pay  for  the  PS3  games  we  already  own  instead  of  making  the  PS4  backwards  compatible. __label__0
I  don't  care  how  many  hundreds  of  people  died  climbing  Everest,  it's  only  worth  $15  TOPS  to  recreate  the  experience  in  the  comfort  of  my  own  underwear. __label__1
That  somehow,  as  system  application,  has  almost  5  stars  and  resides  along  with  other  MS  apps  in  Best-rated  section...  I  do  wonder,  who's  behind  such  idea. __label__1
You  gotta  make  sure  to  get  at  least  4  guys  bunch  up  in  the  radius  of  a  mortar  and  agro  it  to  other  teammates  who  aren't  in  it. __label__0
Yeh  coz  the  DZ  certainly  isnt  boring  right....  Running  in  circles  .....  opening  boxes....  greifing  the  shit  out  of  other  players...  all  fun  fun  fun  fun __label__0
The  DEA  may  have  faith  in  Rodgers,  but  they  are  an  antiquated  remnant  of  the  war  on  drugs  that  has  no  right  to  comment  on  football. __label__1
Yep,  raising  a  pig  with  care  and  painlessly  killing  it  for  meat  in  food  is  *totally*  the  same  thing  as  snapping  a  dogs  neck  for  losing  a  race __label__1
Since  quite  a  bit  of  my  family  is  from  Yorkshire  I  feel  happy  to  say  it's  probably  because  of  how  lazy  and  obese  they  are  :) __label__1
And  I'm  sure  all  the  other  self-declared  Freeman-on-the-Land  followers  out  there  will  see  the  error  of  their  ways  and  not  make  the  same  mistake  this  guy  did. __label__0
maybe  a  complete  recall,  shift  of  focus  to  traditional  halo  found  in  the  MCC,  and  a  promise  not  to  ruin  halo  again  in  another  3  years  time? __label__1
God  forbid  they  would  listen  to  a  song  with  a  name  like  "teenagers"  why  would  that  even  remotely  interest  them  even  on  a  sarcastic  and  satirical  level? __label__1
It's  a  good  think  that  no  tyrant  will  ever  use  such  information  for  his  own  ends,  because  our  country  is  too  informed  and  vigilant  to  ever  elect  one. __label__0
Don't  be  silly,  if  you  did  that  then  you'd  have  to  start  measuring  things  you  actually  care  about  rather  than  vanity  metrics  like  "hits"  or  serp  positions __label__0
Because  Skyrim  is  the  only  instance  ever  when  taking  someone's  knee  out  with  a  sharp  object  is  a  fast  way  to  end  a  battle  before  it  begins. __label__0
Yeah,  but  how  awesome  must  it  be  to  be  able  to  tell  people  you  meet  in  real  life  that  you're  kind  of  a  big  deal  on  the  internet? __label__0
Absolutely  not,  and  make  sure  you  visit  this  sub  before  you  make  any  big  decision  so  that  you  don't  mess  up  like  you  almost  did  this  time. __label__0
Third  age  looks  too  nice,  gotta  tone  it  down  a  bit  to  keep  it  looking  as  shit  as  the  rest  of  the  dyed  3rd  age  pieces. __label__0
Haven't  you  heard,  everyone  who  disagrees  with  you  at  all  is  obviously  a  paid  shill,  since  nobody  would  willingly  have  such  a  wrong  opinion  as  yours. __label__0
Yes,  it  is  by  law  that  people  driving  less  than  10  over  the  speed  limit  in  the  left  lane  can  get  a  ticket  for  driving  too  slow __label__1
Well,  I  mean  there's  a  urinal  next  to  the  toilet...  no  reason  for  me  to  hog  the  bathroom  to  shit  if  someone  wants  to  piss  next  to  me. __label__1
his  Q  have  0  damage,  his  W  dont  give  any  steroids  +  low  mobility,  his  E  dont  reveal  champs  so  it  is  crap,  his  ultimate  deal  0  damage... __label__1

Its  the  police  and  white  privilege's  fault  these  people  have  no  choice  but  to  become  violent  thugs  that  harm  and  continually  burden  society  and  its  real  members __label__0
when  they  are  on  land  you  are  supposed  to  say  something  snarky  about  how  they  use  iphones  and  macbooks  even  though  they  are  protesting  a  corporation. __label__1
In  their  defense,  it  can  be  awfully  hard  to  see  a  massive  vehicle,  full  of  lit  windows,  that  is  all  the  way  across  the  road  way. __label__0
Come  on  man,  the  HOH  comp  was  over  like  2  hours  ago,  Natalie  should  be  over  it  already  and  have  accepted  she's  going  home  and  losing  the  game! __label__1
I'm  sure  it  was  unrelated  that  Kap  said  he  would  opt  out  of  his  contract  that  morning  and  Kelly  benching  him  in  the  game  that  day __label__1
Well,  we  make  every  heterosexual  person  getting  married  get  tested  to  prove  they  are  fertile,  so  it's  reasonable  to  ban  gay  marriage  because  they  can't  be  fertile. __label__1
So  it  seems  we  just  need  to  stop  showing  women  being  pleasured...that  is  much  worse  for  teens  to  see  than  the  horrific  violence  thats  allowed...yeah  that  makes  sense. __label__0
Shadow  man  is  freeza  haha  1st  form  is  the  old  guy  2nd  is  the  one  at  the  end  of  the  trailer  and  third  is  this  one __label__0
Yeah,  we  are  pretty  overpowered,  sucks  that  a  race  with  inherently  stronger  and  more  cost  efficient  units  can't  have  the  same  economy  as  a  zerg...terran  and  toss  need  buffs... __label__0
What  happens  in  the  future  when  craft  beer  is  popular  and  mainstream;  will  we  have  to  go  to  Coors  and  Budweiser  to  find  an  edgy,  rare,  underground  brand? __label__0
If  a  defensive  play  stops  them  one  time,  I'm  pretty  sure  that  means  it  will  stop  them  again  the  next  3  plays,  no  matter  what  they  call. __label__1
Don't  you  know  her  art  is  above  criticism,  because  it  is  a  manifestation  of  her  individuality  that  is  neither  influenced  by  societal  tropes  nor  meant  for  **public**  dissemination __label__0
Well  don't  you  know  that  everyone  who  is  anti-Israel  or  even  not  100%  pro-Israel  is  automatically  a  clear  as  day  raging  anti-Semite  and  a  Holocaust  denier. __label__0
Yeah  man,  like  all  those  oil  companies  buying  up  the  patents  for  the  super  efficient  carburetors  and  shelving  them  so  they  can  keep  selling  lots  of  oil! __label__0
Well,  if  sending  it  to  support  is  a  no  go,  post  it  here,  we  can  brigade  them  and  spam  afk  thumbs  down  every  match  they  have __label__0
Well  he  does  appear  to  be  the  only  one  to  have  an  "Apple  Air",  so  obviously  he  has  access  to  equipment  the  rest  of  us  don't. __label__1
Yeah  I  hate  the  way  it  takes  more  than  a  few  days  to  get  a  legendary,  really  poor  decision  by  ANet  to  make  something  vaguely  time  consuming  to  get. __label__0
Well,  the  mother  was  told  her  child  was  possessed  by  evil  spirits,  which  is  a  perfectly  reasonable  attitude  in  this  day  and  age.....and  ah...  we  gotta  respect  her  beliefs. __label__0
Yup  all  the  problems  and  discrimination  that  black  people  faced  as  a  result  of  slavery  are  all  over  and  taken  care  of,  its  exactly  the  same  thing! __label__1
I'm  sure  that  infertile  women  who  can't  have  kids  and  instead  have  to  have  dogs  that  are  their  babies  would  totally  agree  with  these  "real"  moms. __label__0
Nice  of  them  to  broadcast  these  people's  mugshots  and  charges  so  that  we'll  know  what  these  monsters  look  like  when  they  go  on  to  commit  mass  murder. __label__0
Just  like  Obama  was  able  to  convince  the  nation  that  his  healthcare  law  was  in  their  best  interests  and  they  welcomed  it  with  open  arms  and  soaring  approval  ratings. __label__1
If  they  can't  afford  to  be  poor  in  WI,  maybe  they'll  all  move  to  MN  or  IL  and  it  will  help  our  state  in  the  long  run. __label__0
If  having  red  hot  blind  hatred  for  a  22  year  old  woman  that  I've  never  met  and  don't  know  at  all  is  wrong,  I  don't  wanna  be  right. __label__1
Oh  ye,  plz  take  care  of  the  10  special  snowflakes  in  this  world  that  want  to  use  a  LINUX  PC  as  Gaming  PC....  its  soooo  important. __label__0
if  we  want  to  make  a  bad  tactical  decision  we  should  be  able  too,  i  want  a  40x  scope  on  my  mac  11  why  can't  i  have  it? __label__0
Now  remember,  you  only  own  a  LICENSE  to  use  that  software  and  the  vendor  will  happily  issue  replacement  media  for  a  nominal  fee  upon  proof  of  purchase. __label__0
But  no,  this  cannot  be,  there  absolutely  must  be  a  thirdworld  hivemind  of  people  wanting  to  bring  down  Western  society  or  my  entire  worldview  will  crumble! __label__1
Sure,  the  American  people  are  a  very  discerning  populace  that  constantly  look  for  and  identify  issues  in  rhetoric,  so  I'm  sure  that  will  diminish  the  rhetoric's  effectiveness. __label__0
Yeah,  because  taking  full  control  of  the  railways  and  marching  millions  of  men  through  a  small  country  will  have  no  negative  side  effects  to  the  country  affected. __label__0
you  must  be  soe  kinda  woman  hating  misogynistic  cis  gendered  white  man  for  not  voting  her  her,  SHE  HAS  A  VAGINA  and  that's  all  that  matters. __label__0
Yeah  instead  of  DoA  going  off  topic  in  a  lul,  I  really  prefer  Riv  reading  the  score  board  or  telling  us  how  someone  picks  up  a  buff. __label__0
You  don't  need  to  wear  helmets  all  the  time,  just  when  shit  like  that  happens,  you  can  go  like  99%  of  the  time  with  out  one. __label__0
His  intelligence  shines  like  the  sun  -  it  is  only  natural  that  we  mortal  avert  our  eyes  before  the  magnificence  that  we  can  not  understand  before  it  destroys  us. __label__0
I'm  sure  a  lawsuit  to  overturn  a  supermajority  of  the  public's  will  is  going  to  lead  to  really  favorable  election  results  for  all  those  officials  down  the  road. __label__0
I  simply  want  to  complain  about  things  I  entirely  made  up  and  do  not  want  to  provide  the  source  for  it  man,  don't  be  so  weird! __label__0
Ya  know  I  originally  thought  your  logic  was  bullshit,  but  that  cartoon  character  is  really  hot  so  I  think  I  might  have  to  agree  with  you. __label__0
This  is  the  perfect  way  to  end  any  series  and  I  think  it's  just  going  to  go  down  in  history  as  the  best  for  a  very  long  time. __label__0
I  would  have  thought  top  priority  was  "update  character  nobody  uses"  and  "fail  to  nerf  pocket  sniper  and  Super90"  but  I  guess  cheating  is  important  too! __label__1
