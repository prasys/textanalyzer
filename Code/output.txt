Should  use  the  same  logic  with  white  supremacists...  KKK  said  blacks  were  inferior  100  years  ago,  so  it  must  be  true  because  someone  said  it  before  now. __label__0
You  think  it's  bad  now,  as  I  recall  with  damage  3.0  they're  planning  a  max  mod  cap  period,  because  that's  going  to  help  people  be  flexible  I'm  sure. __label__0
But...  but...  the  title  of  the  article  is  anti-Hillary...  Doesn't  that  mean  auto-upvote  to  get  it  to  the  front  page  without  any  thought  or  reading  what-so-ever? __label__0
Yah,  fuck  it,  lets  just  ban  that  shit...  Let  the  bitch  down  with  the  ship  after  a  botched  back  alley  abortion  involving  bleach  and  a  coat  hanger. __label__1
You're  right,  the  part  of  the  American  justice  system  that  manages  copy  right  is  also  the  same  people  who  deploy  the  army  and  handle  foreign  policy __label__0
Is  it  ok  if  we  start  banning  the  "Is  it  okay  if  we  start  banning  the  'is  it  ok  if  we  ban'  the  'is  it  ok'  posts"? __label__0
Our  only  hope  is  that  the  weapons  and  supplies  are  stamped  with  a  giant  American  flag  so  they  know  who  truly  has  their  back  in  the  good  fight. __label__1
Do  what  the  guy  in  front  of  me  did:  Put  chains  on  all  4  tires  of  your  all  wheel  drive  Sienna,  then  drive  17  in  a  45.... __label__0
The  same  thing  as  everyone  else  who  gets  a  gym  membership  for  the  first  time  -  decide  it's  too  much  work,  give  up  and  eat  some  chips __label__1
Welcome  to  reddit,  where  any  problem  in  the  United  States  is  the  fault  of  President  Obama,  he  being  the  first  president  to  make  promises  he  didn't  keep __label__0
Because  the  people  are  bringing  water  in  from  an  outside  source  then  when  they  pee  it  goes  into  the  local  septic  system  which  ends  up  in  the  sound. __label__1
Obviously  the  coaches  saw  something  in  Gaudreau  and  put  him  on  the  first  line  to  boost  McDavid  since  he  didn't  get  a  single  point  last  night. __label__0
they  may  have  the  best  eduction,  but  they're  a  bunch  of  socialist  atheists,  so  what  does  it  matter  when  they  are  bunch  of  immoral,  baby-murdering,  Godless  sinners  ? __label__1
Then  obviously  he  should  be  fired  because  gays  don't  deserve  jobs  and  if  you're  paying  that  gay  then  you're  supporting  homosexuality  and  jesus  hates  you  for  that. __label__0
Yeah,  I'm  not  really  digging  these  answers,  so  i  will  just  remake  the  askreddit  post  a  week  from  now  and  hope  for  answers  more  to  my  liking __label__1
You're  so  right;  when  I  think  of  Call  of  Duty,  I  definitely  think  of  it  as  being  on  par  with  Five  Nights  at  Freddys  and  Organ  Trail. __label__0
You  soloQ  fanboys  are  a  minority  as,  according  to  Lyte,  one  major  reddit  poll  made  it  clear  that  most  of  the  13  people  who  voted  didn't  want  it. __label__0
If  you  consider  that  blue  is  a  very  rare  color  for  cars,  and  almost  no  cars  are  blue,  this  is  very  strong  evidence  for  SA's  guilt. __label__1
Seriously,  how  can  anyone  believe  redstate  would  post  anything  other  than  negative  about  anything  related  to  Hillary,  but  it  agrees  with  my  bias  so  it  must  be  true __label__0
This  just  proves  that  le  80s  were  better  before  everyone,  even  the  cool  kids,  turned  into  a  bunch  of  PC  wimps  who  can't  handle  a  little  edge. __label__0
But  bro  I  only  lost  because  my  team  sucks  and  the  game  sucks,  and  the  guns  suck,  and  there  were  hackers,  and  lag  comp  and  and  and  and.... __label__1
OP  is  just  some  white  knight  who  always  comes  to  the  aid  of  the  female,  if  you  knew  her  you'd  know  how  much  of  a  whore  she  is. __label__0
Haha  man  I'm  kidding  I  don't  have  the  cash  for  such  a  nice  board,  unless  you  want  a  cm  storm  trigger  and  a  seidon  240m  as  trade. __label__0
Clearly  the  cammer's  fault;  if  he  hadn't  been  recording,  the  police  escort  wouldn't  have  had  to  stop  to  investigate  and  the  chain  reaction  wouldn't  have  happened. __label__1
ADD,  acute  stress  disorder,  male  erectile  disorder,  hyper  sexuality,  narcissism,  premature  ejaculate  disorder,  dyslexia  -  all  perfectly  good  reasons  to  put  these  threats  to  society  on  this  list. __label__1
You're  right,  there's  something  wrong  with  every  Galaxy  Nexus  ever  made,  as  can  be  seen  by  every  GNex  owner  on  this  entire  subreddit  and  in  the  entire  world. __label__0
Yay  that  was  so  much  fun  when  people  would  go  up  there  with  the  flag  and  wait  for  people  to  quit  so  they  could  get  a  win. __label__0
What  an  articulate  and  level  headed  answer,  by  someone  who  has  clearly  read,  assimilated  and  critically  thought  about  the  points  laid  out  in  front  of  him. __label__0
Let's  have  the  game  between  top  8  teams  at  S3  Worlds  be  worth  the  same  as  the  game  between  two  teams  who  were  1  game  away  from  relegation! __label__1
If  I  was  a  was  a  yoga  intstructer  or  star  bucks  barrista  and  then  magically  over  night  was  making  125k  a  year  I'd  support  her  too. __label__1
No,  he's  supposed  to  call  911  and  patiently  wait  for  an  officer  to  arrive,  while  some  random  thugs  beat  the  shit  out  of  him  and  run  away. __label__1
Oh  there  will  be,  thankfully  people  set  up  bots  to  buy  all  the  tickets  in  the  first  minute  and  let  actual  fans  pay  2-3x  the  price! __label__0
So,  it  is  quite  obvious  that  we  need  a  penile-transfer-union,  because  the  harmonisation  with  the  freedom  of  movement  is  clearly  not  working  and  is  a  failed  policy. __label__0
I  am  sad  that  they  fired  Helfrich,  he  was  a  local  guy  who  helped  us  achieve  our  first  CW  win  in  so  long  :(  *crocodile  tears* __label__0
Well,  obviously  since  you  knew  *one*  kid  with  Asperger's  that  could  be  violent  at  times,  all  people  within  the  autism  spectrum  will  grow  up  to  commit  mass  murder. __label__0
I  believe  she  had  just  finished  a  workout,  maybe  she  was  just  turning  off  the  sweaty,  cause  who  would  ever  want  to  hug  her  sweaty...  LOL __label__0
Can't  forget  Machine  Gun  Kelly,  Yelawolf,  Mac  Miller,  Action  Bronson  They  only  talk  about  real  problems  not  like  those  dark  skinned  rapper  (Hopsin  is  the  only  exception). __label__0
But  their  outrage  goes  against  the  world  policy  of  we  are  all  ONE  people...teach  the  kids  young  and  now  before  we  become  more  separated  but  equal. __label__1
Thats  why  its  beeing  used  in  science..  coz  its  easy..  not  coz  its  more  accurate  ofcourse..  how  did  we  get  that  idea..  Scientists  always  want  the  easy  option.. __label__1
Oh  things  will  really  kick  off  when  they  start  talking  about  physics  optimisations  and  show  maybe  2  screenshots  of  Source  2  and  perhaps  some  footage  of  physics  simulation. __label__0
Nah  man,  clearly  the  critics  are  out  to  kill  Warcraft  which  comes  from  an  adored  director  with  2  previously  acclaimed  films  because  Disney's  got  everyone  on  the  payroll __label__0
Well,  we've  outlawed  kids  from  having  sex  with  each  other  and  with  adults,  and  that  has  obviously  worked,  so  we  just  need  to  outlaw  sex  for  the  poor. __label__0
If  only  Trudeau  could  be  more  like  dear  leader  Harper  was  (may  his  grace  bless  us),  this  country  wouldn't  be  going  to  the  scary  dark  people! __label__0
Guy  on  the  left  is  stuck  in  black  skinny  jeans  while  his  buddies  have  MC  and  ATACS-FG;  what  a  terrible  way  to  go  to  war...  :( __label__1

What  are  you  talking  about,  i  love  getting  bodied  by  a  tier  3  myers  after  i  get  matched  with  rank  20's  that  just  bought  the  game. __label__0
So  they  would  compromise  the  quality  of  their  own  product  in  another  place  to  deal  with  the  bad  quality  in  another  location...  OP  is  a  fucking  genius __label__0
...  I  mean...  It's  not  like  it's  their  job  to  properly  count  and  hand  me  money  or  anything...  Or  that  a  5  year  old  could  do  it  properly... __label__0
the  comments  under  the  article  indicate  their  readership  consists  of  only  putinbots  or  the  british  are  not  falling  for  western  narrative..  it  has  to  be  putinbots __label__0
the  closer  you  get  to  the  center  of  the  "universe"  you  have  to  pay  more  ,  so  be  ready  only  rich  people  will  get  to  the  center __label__0
well  DE  did  increase  Oxium  output  by  10  times,  but  they  are  also  increasing  the  demand  by  the  same  order...  i  guess  this  is  called  "balanced". __label__0
Yep  that  will  make  them  feel  better  when  they  can  barely  pay  their  student  loans  for  their  four  year  degree  that  was  required  for  a  higher  skilled  job. __label__0
And  then  we  can  watch  bill  nye  reruns  while  bashing  everyone  who  watches  any  mainstream  media,  because  we  are  so  scientific  and  the  rest  of  the  world  are  idiots. __label__0
Yeah,  the  greatest  thing  about  Virtual  Reality  is  truly  realilty,  why  visit  magical  otherworldly  places  when  you  can  visit  places  you  could  have  seen  without  a  800$  headset __label__1
But  I  don't  need  to  prove  that  there  is  no  God,  because  you  can't  prove  that  there  is  one  so  that  makes  me  justified  in  my  assholish  comments __label__0
But,  PBE  is  the  place  for  free  skins,  I  shouldn't  have  to  deal  with  new  buggy  or  OP  stuff  just  to  enjoy  the  new  skin  for  free. __label__0
When  I  wear  deodorant  I'm  basically  lying  to  women  about  what  I  smell  like  When  I  clean  myself  in  the  shower  I'm  basically  lying  about  how  clean  I  am __label__1
I'd  love  to  think  of  what  Britain  would  look  like  without  nuclear  weapons,  because  everyone  knows  that  MAD  was  a  complete  failure  of  a  policy  right __label__0
Oh  yeah,  the  current  ultra  strict  laws  that  don't  affect  criminals  are  not  working  so  the  obvious  answer  is  to  pass  stricter  laws  that  wont  affect  criminals. __label__1
You're  so  right,  there's  a  just  a  WHOLE  lineup  of  McClements  and  Kulemins  in  the  minors,  ready  to  be  called  up  to  play  defensive  offense  for  the  leafs... __label__0
If  this  ever  gets  to  the  supreme  court  the  ruling  could  be:  it's  acceptable  because  if  someone  finds  it  unacceptable  they  don't  have  to  read  the  sign. __label__0
If  the  console  is  only  rendering  3fps  then  the  game  will  look  10-20  times  better  than  it  would  at  60fps  because  it  has  more  time  to  render  it  better __label__1
Because  South  Korea  has  high  rates  of  cosmetic  surgery  relative  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  *every*  attractive  Korean  is  *obviously*  the  result  of  cosmetic  surgery. __label__1
I'm  sure  tons  of  companies  will  be  lining  up  to  invest  in  wind  and  solar  in  a  province  that  has  a  history  of  reneging  on  contracts __label__0
TIL  that  no  women  liked  this  movie;  that  the  director  wanted  it  that  way;  and  that  it  is  bad  for  a  movie  to  appeal  mostly  to  men. __label__0
But  by  ridding  the  world  of  white  people,  they'd  actually  be  making  a  really  efficient  wish,  by  ridding  the  world  of  violence,  hate,  AND  racism  all  at  once. __label__1
Yep,  and  I'm  sure  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  publishing  your  picture  in  local  print  media,  television,  and  online,  influencing  public  perception  of  innocence  or  guilt. __label__1
I  for  one  am  thrilled  that  Gardner  and  his  men  risked  life,  limb,  and  the  safety  of  the  citizens  of  Cedar  Rapids  to  protect  us  from  this  dangerous  thug. __label__0
I  love  how  everyone  here  is  responding  to  the  stereotyping  of  Canadians  by  stereotyping  Americans  and  members  of  Christian  faith...  Really  proving  how  much  better  we  are __label__0
Yeah,  because  the  entire  video  indicates  that  the  people  around  the  person  with  the  camera  really  care  about  the  well  being  of  the  person  that  was  knocked  out. __label__0
Yes,  3  weeks  is  an  appropriate  amount  of  time  to  say  that  we  love  BB8  as  much  as  we've  loved  R2D2  for  the  last  40  years... __label__0
if  you  can't  juggle  3  jobs,  make  exemplary  grades,  and  keep  a  perfect  social  life,  you  aren't  trying  hard  enough  and  don't  deserve  to  even  live. __label__1
Right,  because  these  kids  want  to  sit  out  in  a  chance  to  pull  of  the  biggest  upset  of  their  career,  and  waste  Clock  in  OT  .... __label__1
Did  you  know  the  H  in  H2O  stands  for  hydrogen,  did  you  know  they  used  hydrogen  to  make  atom  bombs,  ergo  WATER  IS  BAD  FOR  YOU! __label__1
If  we  were  able  to  sell  our  resources  (specifically  alloy  plates),  I'd  be  richer  than  the  entire  Corpus,  Grineer,  and  Orokin  factions  were,  are,  and  will  ever  be. __label__0
Yeah  I'm  sure  this  will  happen,  just  like  people  kicked  me  from  groups  for  not  having  Blackwyrm  gems  or  not  having  Valentine  gem  on  all  my  characters. __label__0
Well,  after  looking  at  your  past  comments  and  the  subs  you  frequent,  I've  decided  that  your  position  on  this  subject  is  invalid  because  reasons  and  stuff. __label__0
Just  because  there  aren't  plans  for  one  now  doesn't  mean  there  won't  ever  be  one  Give  it  30  years  or  so  for  the  all  woman  cast  edition __label__1
We  men  don't  care  as  along  as  we  can  go  shoot  guns  in  the  army  and  get  kinky  sex  from  our  GFs  when  we  get  back  home. __label__1
And,  in  the  days  after  that,  there  will  also  be  a  complex,  nuanced  national  dialogue  of  the  solution  to  keeping  these  shootings  from  happening  again  free  of  political  bias. __label__0
I  think  a  lot  of  fandroids  are  happy  that  their  phone  are  the  ones  left  with  3.5mm  jack...  I'm  pretty  sure  they're  not  gonna  copy  Apple... __label__0
When  a  dozen  of  them  become  criminals,  it  will  be  obvious  that  all  42k  should  be  rounded  up  and  deported,  straight  back  to  Syria  or  whatever. __label__1
I  too  would  be  shocked  if  the  "I  found  it  in  the  bin"  defence  wasn't  a  get  out  of  jail  free  card  for  any  charges  of  handling  stolen  goods __label__0
Right,  because  in  a  free  world  you  are  only  permitted  the  same  rights  the  country  of  your  genetic  or  spiritual  heritage  allows  to  the  rest  of  the  world. __label__1
I  hate  to  be  that  person  but  because  you  are  from  the  US  then  you  are  ignorant  to  the  fact  that  spelt  is  far  superior  to  spelled __label__0
Ah  yes,  as  we  all  know,  those  who  don't  have  flairs  are  heretics,  should  have  their  opinions  ignored,  and  are  in  general  failures  as  human  beings. __label__1
But  of  course  speed  has  nothing  to  do  with  this,  if  the  lambo  had  been  traveling  under  the  speed  of  light  the  mazda  should  have  seen  him  coming. __label__1
No  no,  it  has  to  do  with  other  Euro  countries  such  as  Germany  punishing  innocent  Greeks  by  asking  the  Greek  government  to  pay  back  its  debt  obligations. __label__0
Now  I  have  never  been  to  California  but  I  do  watch  pot  cops  and  that  looks  like  a  grow  site  to  me  maybe  that's  why  it's  so  cheap __label__0
Depression  apparently  is  still  okay  to  make  fun  of,  I  mean  its  not  like  they  were  fat  cause  that's  serious  and  you  shouldn't  make  fun  of  that __label__1
Yea  like  in  Ancient  Greece  too  where  the  banks  paid  them  to  wage  war  on  Troy  and  blame  it  on  wanting  to  bang  Helen  of  Troy __label__1
Setting  aside  the  football  context  for  a  moment,  brilliant  idea  by  the  marketing  department  to  come  up  with  the  image  of  a  Muslim  smashing  up  a  tower  block. __label__0
If  you  drink  and  drive,  at  least  do  it  when  you  are  a  teenager  so  you  can  use  "affluenza"  as  as  excuse  and  get  away  with  it. __label__0
Given  that  the  Affordable  Care  Act  was  implemented  in  its  cost-reducing  entirety  in  2009,  this  certainly  seems  like  a  major  blow  to  the  Obama  administration's  health  care  plan... __label__1
He's  eligible  for  the  Selective  Service  draft  as  of  3  years  ago...  but  all  20  somethings  have  an  iffy  history  with  the  law,  so  it's  all  good. __label__0
Wow  okay  I  see  you  are  clearly  the  superior  human  being  and  I  will  from  now  on  refer  only  to  you  in  all  matters  of  taste. __label__0
If  only  they  had  some  sort  of  manager  position  at  Bungie  whose  job  it  was  to  communicate  with  the  community  about  things  like  this...a  community  manager,  if  you  will... __label__1
I  am  sure  after  his  act  of  bravery,  he  has  to  use  a  use  a  stick  to  beat  away  all  the  pussy  coming  his  way  now. __label__1
Something  you  watch  for  enjoyment  v  something  that  has  to  be  scrutinised  for  fractures  or  other  abnormalities,  can't  see  why  one  uses  so  much  more  data __label__0
Yeah  like  all  of  those  traders  who  shorted  REITs  a  few  months  ago,  they  must  be  crying  their  eyes  out  about  all  those  dividends  they  had  to  cough  up. __label__1
Gee  it'd  be  a  shame  we  don't  get  to  see  who  he'd  invite  to  sit  next  to  Melania  at  the  State  of  the  Union  every  year. __label__0
Well,  when  you  think  Obama  founded  ISIS  and  isn't  even  fighting  them,  it's  easy  to  get  scared  and  need  scorched-earth  boots-on-the-ground  type  war  to  feel  safer. __label__1
Can't  wait  for  that  cuck  Justin  Trudeau  to  appologise  to  the  islamists  for  the  blood  on  their  swords  they  had  to  clean  after  that  islamophobe  got  punished.... __label__0
But  it's  really  fast  on  the  4x4  matrices  I  tested  in  Matlab,  computers  are  so  fast  these  days  I  can't  imagine  you  would  ever  need  anything  else! __label__0
I'll  be  waiting  for  part  2  of  the  series  on  the  gender  gap  in  coal  miners,  and  part  3  on  the  gender  gap  in  homeless  populations  and  in  prisons. __label__0
It  isn't  your  body  anymore  if  you  let  it  be  healthy,  you've  got  to  let  it  be  in  it's  "natural"  state  for  it  to  classify  as  yours. __label__1
wow  a  governor  who  is  completely  bought  and  paid  for  by  the  massive  health  insurance  companies  in  Connecticut  is  trying  to  reduce  payments  to  hospitals,  color  me  shocked __label__0
Well  your  summary  of  a  long  standing  problem  in  the  weapons  system  that  people  have  been  pointing  out  since  before  gamma  is  certainly  nuanced  and  intelligent. __label__0
No  way  man,  you  still  spoiled  it  -  by  having  to  read  your  title  without  seeing  a  spoiler  tag,  now  he  knows  that  the  game  has  endings. __label__0
Maybe  you  can  write  a  big  big  "Please  show  yourself  out"  on  a  picture  of  a  bleeding  heart  That  will  work  when  dealing  with  people  that  respect  PC __label__0
Yeah,  an  ice  cream  is  so  much  less  creative  than  a  pokeball  with  eyes  or  a  pile  of  sludge  with  eyes  or  a  rock  with  eyes. __label__0
i  have  clients  that  blame  us  for  quarantined  emails  through  Postini  because  we  go  through  and  watch  every  email  roll  in  and  quarantine  said  person  out  of  spite __label__0
It's  a  real  joy  paying  $20  for  a  quick  trip  and  get  asked  for  directions  when  the  driver  has  three  GPS  units  in  front  of  em __label__0
Yes  exactly  why  can't  everyone  have  the  same  music  taste  as  me  so  I  don't  have  to  feel  superior  when  I  hear  someone  listening  to  le  (c)rap? __label__0
Yes,  you  were  so  poorly  behaved  from  being  cooped  up  as  punishment  I  will  force  you  to  stay  here  that  won't  backfire  on  me  at  all! __label__0
Ya'know,  besides  using  it  for  rushing,  shatters,  castle,  oryx,  wc,  tomb  bosses...  so  all  the  places  you  would  want  to  use  an  oreo  you  can  use  this! __label__0
Sure,  if  you  call  banning  abortion,  gay  marriage,  kill  national  healthcare,  free  college  tuition,  and  removing  money  from  politics  as  productive...then  Bernie  is  only  holding  this  country  back. __label__0
Don't  you  know  that  cause  he's  a  socialist  that  made  it  big  he  has  to  change  his  ideology  and  we  can't  listen  to  his  music  either? __label__0

Oh,  yeah,  going  on  and  on  about  how  he's  gonna  want  her  dick  so  bad  after  she  has  him  makes  a  WONDERFUL  impression  on  a  girl's  father. __label__0
Yeah  because  "I'll  send  you  $4  **for  shits  and  giggles**"  means  that  "Hey  I  want  that  thing  you  posted  about"  it  seem  like  common  sence  doesn't  it? __label__1
But  if  we  release  those  prisoners  into  the  work  force  and  fire  the  guards  and  police  responsible  for  putting  and  keeping  them  there,  won't  that  just  increase  unemployment? __label__1

Yes,  the  fact  that  the  Bucs  got  penalized  16  times  is  evidence  that  the  refs  were  biased,  not  that  the  Bucs  committed  a  lot  of  penalties  that  game __label__0

Yeah  because  a  gay  rights  rally  has  people  running  around  having  sex  all  the  time,  because  people  being  gay  is  only  about  sexual  acts,  and  not  civil  rights. __label__1
Besides  having  lovely  breasts  and  beautiful  tan  skin  and  being  thin  and  fit  and  having  a  beautiful  face  what's  is  this  girl  really  bringing  to  the  table? __label__1

But  I  thought  that  the  gayhomobuttfags  sought  out  to  drive  the  sanctity  of  marriage  into  the  ground,  and  turn  all  of  our  god  fearing,  completely  innocent  children  gay __label__1

I  agree,  and  that's  why  I  think  Mass  effect  3  is  just  as  good  as  the  first  2  and  Dead  Space  3  coop  was  the  best  idea  ever. __label__0
Well  the  good  ones  need  at  least  someone  to  initiate  with  them  to  ace  you,  the  great  ones  just  run  into  your  team  and  get  a  pentakill. __label__0
Don't  be  silly,  Jay  intercepted,  killed,  and  buried  Hae  while  using  Adnan's  phone  and  car,  and  hanging  out  with  Adnan  all  day,  and  Adnan  was  none  the  wiser. __label__0
The  sun  is  gonna  destroy  us  in  a  few  billion  years  anyways,  so  why  does  it  matter  if  we  die  out  in  the  next  few  centuries? __label__0
Those  women  were  probably  forced  into  ruling  positions  by  oppressive  men...  and  they  were  just  emulating  male  rulers  anyway,  so  they  are  honorary  patriarchs,  not  real  women  rulers. __label__0
because  the  person  who  is  collecting  is  no  where  near  as  qualified  as  me  to  play  the  game  and  they  are  getting  money  and  not  meeeeee. __label__1
Yup  I  totally  should  have  my  right  to  carry  my  pistol  taken  away  because  a  guy  who  lives  1500  miles  away  from  me  did  something  bad! __label__0

As  I  learned  from  reddit  we  are  collapsing  from  the  refugee  crisis  and  the  right  wing,  mainly  AFD,  will  win  the  next  election  by  a  landslide. __label__0
So  he  only  need  to  do  it  like  6  more  times  like  you  guys  made  Trump  disavow  the  KKK,  because  Sanders  didn't  *really*  disavow  correctly  the  first  time. __label__0
They  obviously  aren't  allowed  to  assemble,  because  the  assembly  is  for  the  purpose  of  spreading  hate  and  racism,  and  they  were  going  to  incite  violence  anyway! __label__1
No  didn't  you  hear  Snowden  found  the  formula  for  immortality  in  the  NSA  documents  he  didn't  leak,  so  this  is  a  threat  to  have  him  assassinated. __label__1
Well  this  is  just  outrageous,  You  little  Brats  need  to  be  tied  down  and  force  fed  your  fruit  and  veggies,  or  else  you  will  be  obese  and  ugly..... __label__1
I  know,  the  evil  West  doesn't  understand  Russia  only  wants  whats  best  for  Ukraine..  it's  not  as  if  they  annexed  Crimea  nor  are  they  supporting  the  Eastern  front. __label__0
The  daily  "valve  should  fix  the  game"  thread  and  the  "I  took  a  java  entry  course,  here's  what  valve  can  do  to  fix  the  game"  comments. __label__0
Maybe  they're  behind  the  hacker  threats  so  that  they'll  get  publicity  for  canceling  the  movie  at  first  then  bringing  it  back  so  more  people  will  want  to  see  it. __label__0
Hey  when  your  key  witness  has  43359  different  versions  of  events,  sometimes  you  gotta  take  the  jury  by  the  hand  and  (mis)lead  them  to  the  conclusion  you  want __label__0

I'm  sure  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  fact  that  two  of  the  most  influential  members  of  the  committee  are  former  coaches  of  Big  10  teams. __label__0

If  we  just  let  women  go  around  doing  what  they  want,  then  they  might  trick  us  into  doing  something  bad  again  and  god  might  put  more  curses  on  us! __label__0
It's  to  offset  the  price  of  the  PS4  Neo,  this  way  they  don't  have  to  charge  so  much  and  be  more  competitive  with  the  upcoming  Scorpio. __label__0
Because  he's  not  played  so  much  anymore  I  remember  the  time  when  he  was  played  in  competitive  and  he'd  just  oneshot  people  straight  from  100-0  good  champ  imo. __label__0

Shhhh...  Reddit  is  pro-socialist  borderline  Marxist/communist...  Dont  come  in  here  with  those  "work  hard"  values...  These  people  want  money,  so  why  can't  we  give  it  to  them? __label__1
even  if  the  source  was  100%  unbiased,  half  the  redditors  would  never  believe  it,  because  as  we  all  know,  if  you  got  arrested  and  beat  you  totally  deserved  it. __label__0

Yeah  but  the  Tories  helping  the  poor  is  like  when  billionaires  donate  to  charity,  they  aren't  doing  it  because  they  care  they're  doing  it  for  the  tax  relief. __label__0
So  the  police  will  not  say  whether  this  cop  was  fired  or  resigned,  won't  release  the  body-cam  footage,  and  won't  even  release  a  photo  of  him...  That's  some  discipline! __label__0

I  think  they  play  many  uhc's  in  secret,  but  they  only  record  1  every  few  months  so  that  we  have  to  wait  so  they  get  tons  of  likes/views __label__0
I'm  sure  the  reason  astronauts  don't  light  matches  in  the  space  station  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  risk  of  a  flash  fire  in  the  oxygen  rich  environment. __label__1
That's  not  possible,  he's  played  6  full  games  bro,  we've  seen  enough  to  know  he's  better  than  the  QB  who  holds  basically  every  team  passing  record __label__0
We  get  no  specs,  no  rims,  and  no  colors,  but  at  least  they  were  generous  enough  to  upgrade  the  Miata's  brakes  to  drilled  rotors  for  us __label__0
Yes,  he  made  a  stupid  mistake,  so  he  totally  deserves  to  die,  and  the  driver  of  the  car  deserve  to  carry  that  with  them  their  entire  life... __label__1
so  he  a-moved  banelings  then  clicked  f  SUCH  INCREDIBLE  FUNGALS  HOLY  SHIt  in  low  mmr  (insane  mineral/gas  float)  totally  deserves  a  post  on  reddit  mocking  the  opponent  player. __label__0
if  you  look  to  your  left  you  will  see  Illinois...  it  has  had  a  minimum  wage  of  federal  min  &lt;$1+  for  many  years...  they  are  in  a  great  position __label__0
Cops  are  professionally  trained  to  drive  in  specialised  schools...  this  is  why  they  are  allowed  to  speed  without  flashing  lights,  do  illegal  u-turns  and  text  while  driving. __label__0
Clearly  the  answer  is  for  all  the  people  who'd  be  hit  hardest  by  this  is  to  eat  healthier,  tighten  your  belt  and  pull  yourself  up  by  your  bootstraps __label__1
Yeah,  why  don't  we  just  put  them  nude,  shelterless,  without  prepared  food  and  clean  water  and  dump  them  in  Alaska  where  they  can  fight  the  bears  for  food! __label__1
Yeah..  making  your  own  rating  agencies  with  political  agendas  and  a  clear  bias  against  investment  advice  that's  worked  more  often  than  not..  that'll  work  well  in  pulling  investors. __label__0
But  what  are  they  going  to  add  to  the  PS4s  v2.13  if  they  allowed  all  the  old  features  present  in  last  gen  to  be  available  now? __label__0
Because  there  is  no  way  that  you  could  do  that  to  your  own  face  while  hiding  in  the  woods  for  7  weeks  and  running  from  the  cops. __label__0
I  was  just  going  to  say:  The  game  needs  to  be  patched,  so  there  is  a  recall  so  Nintendo  can  put  out  the  patched  version  of  the  game. __label__1
Did  you  know  that  they  are  in  stock  around  you  and  also  that  they  stop  playing  music  when  you  remove  one  of  them  from  your  ears? __label__0
She  said  it's  the  gold  standard  of  trade  agreements  and  has  lobbied  for  over  3  years  for  it  but  I'm  sure  he's  not  really  for  it __label__0
You  have  convinced  me  that  my  opinion  on  anime  is  inferior  to  yours,  and  I  will  immediately  change  my  opinion  to  be  more  in  line  with  yours,  master. __label__0
Last  2  games:  Mitro,  2  goals,  Ayoze,  3  goals,  Gayle,  0  Goals  Ipswich  and  PNE  soooo,  Mitro  is  clearly  our  best  bet,  as  we've  known  all  along __label__0
Yeah,  it's  much  more  likely  that  a  bunch  of  experienced  outdoorsmen  all  somehow  caught  hypothermia  as  opposed  to  have  encountered  a  violent  wild  animal  in  the  wilderness  of  Russia. __label__1
I  SAW  6  VINES  AND  ONLY  14  PEDESTRIANS  AND  12  CARS,  THIS  GAME  IS  SHIT  AND  I  WILL  NEVER  BUY  IT  YOU  ARE  ALL  SUCKERS  AND  IDIOTS  JBDFGUIAEHBNROGUINSDJKACFNVL __label__0
Yeah  taking  away  a  character's  story  and  making  him  sexually  obsessed  with  pickles  is  totally  not  the  work  of  a  fucking  moron  nope  not  at  all __label__0
Nice,  i  love  it  when  the  german  scene  gives  their  talents  some  place  to  prove  themselves  instead  of  taking  some  old  players  that  already  reached  their  peak __label__0
babe  i  love  you  but  could  you  please  get  a  boob  job,  I'm  just  offering  a  solution  because  I  don't  wanna  break  up  over  a  shallow  problem __label__0
Hurr  durr  someone  disagrees  with  me  and  doesn't  believe  that  wealth  is  something  to  be  disparaged  cause  I'm  not  a  retarded  socialist  so  they  must  be  a  TROLL. __label__1
Because  those  people  that  dislike  this  change  are  just  having  a  knee-jerk  reaction,  not  the  fact  that  this  change  is  detrimental  to  the  functionality  of  the  site. __label__0
Yeah  obviously  she  used  $6  million  to  hire  +5k  people  to  vote  and  post  on  reddit  for  5  months  straight  for  a  whooping  66  cents  per  hour __label__1
No,  they  need  super  metal  looking  dudes  standing  by  them  with  black  shirts  and  black  backgrounds,  making  angry  as  fuck  faces  with  a  grungy  texture  over  everything! __label__1
Guys  all  we  want  is  some  reasonable  gun  regulations  jeez,  just  let  us  ratchet  the  regulations  down  a  little  more  is  all  we  want  for  now __label__0
In  a  way  he's  doing  her  a  favour  by  letting  her  know  how  crappy  of  a  person  he  is  right  off  the  bat  instead  of  further  down  the  line. __label__0
Its  like  the  lambo  suv,  its  for  when  you  need  to  pick  up  the  kids  from  soccer  practice  at  5  and  hit  the  track  at  5:30. __label__0
But  guys...  He's  a  poor  shooter  so  nobody's  defending  him  on  those  half-court  possessions,  that's  why  he  has  space  to  pass  the  ball  to  the  open  man! __label__0
Oh  yeah,  because  the  Republican  Party  is  the  one  with  the  most  embedded  racism,  and  tend  to  feel  a  little  extreme  when  Trump  speaks  his  mind. __label__1
Look,  it's  not  a  logical  leap  to  say  that  if  you  took  a  picture  of  yourself  with  a  gun  and  have  smoked  marijuana  you're  going  to  kill  people. __label__0
Yeah,  what  an  idiot,  getting  a  tattoo  of  something  he  may  potential  love,  something  that  might  have  changed  his  life,  something  that  might  make  him  happy,  fuck  this  guy! __label__1
$10  OP  wants  to  do  something  crazy  with  trading  cards  and  is  just  trying  to  get  you  all  to  sell  them  to  him  on  the  cheap __label__0
Yeah  why  spend  money  on  a  coherent  story,  more  content,  and  more  customization  when  you  can  spend  millions  on  voice  actors  to  say  "What  would  it  be,  Guardian?" __label__0
No,  because  it's  not  okay  for  little  girls  to  try  to  be  masculine,  but  it's  perfectly  okay  to  make  all  boys  act  feminine  and  never  explore  their  masculinity. __label__1
Nah  man,  the  people  in  Paris  care  more  about  what  happened  in  a  dota  2  tournament  right  now,  they  dont  have  other  things  to  worry  about... __label__1
no  way..  I  thought  a  saltire  is  a  heraldic  symbol  in  the  form  of  a  diagonal  cross,  like  the  shape  of  the  letter  X  in  Roman  type. __label__1
I'm  sure  the  farmer  pays  them  quite  generously  that  even  other  American  like  you  or  I,  would  be  willing  to  work  for  such  a  nice  way  of  life. __label__0
The  LORD  will  come  down  and  defeat  these  socialist  commies  with  an  AR-15  in  hand  with  an  army  of  aborted  fetuses  behind  him  all  with  their  own  1911s. __label__1
Yeah  because  if  there's  any  place  that's  likely  to  give  men  custody  of  their  children  and  leave  financial  support  to  the  women,  it's  2nd  and  3rd  world  countries. __label__0
Yea,  I  mean  if  you  *don't*  pull  out  a  gun,  obviously  you  are  a  coward  and  you  don't  love  your  girl  as  much  as  the  other  guy. __label__0
True,  people  are  sending  40%  more  dick  pics  and  liking  50%  more  facebook  posts...  these  SOC  just  aren't  keeping  up  with  the  extreme  demands  users  place  on  them! __label__0
Ya  more  than  double  the  current  output,  drop  a  few  hundred  pounds,  drop  the  price  by  at  least  $6000,  why  didn't  they  do  that  in  the  first  place? __label__1
Don't  worry  I'm  sure  DPS  will  levy  appropriate  disciplinary  measures  on  Bennett,  as  they  are  obviously  very  serious  and  committed  to  protecting  players  from  head  injuries. __label__0
Meeting  up  with  my  friends  in  our  awesome  9000  member  faction,  travelling  the  solar  system  killing  everyone  and  everything  we  meet  and  naming  everything  after  my  dick. __label__1
I  completely  understand  how  it  is  impossible  to  wait  another  30  seconds  to  a  minute  after  a  flight  of  up  to  several  hours...  That  last  0.5%  is  the  hardest. __label__1
Yeah  ok  if  the  video  starts  with  some  immature  kids  imitating  fapping  sounds  with  their  mouths,  you  know  this  is  gonna  be  excellent  entertainment  and  totally  worth  your  time. __label__0
I  can  use  my  nexus  6  to  detect  earthquakes  without  any  app...  I  just  let  it  flat  on  the  table  and  it  will  swing  before  an  earthquake __label__0
It'll  be  faster  for  you  too,  since  the  cable  is  like  a  slide  for  the  data  your  speeds  will  be  way  faster  than  what  he  will  ever  get! __label__0
Yes  but  if  we  have  more  babies,  there  will  be  more  people,  and  the  more  people  we  have,  the  more  people  can  choose  to  not  have  babies! __label__1
My  excuse  is  that  I've  not  figured  out  what  I  want  to  do  with  my  life  yet  and  if  needed  I'll  just  take  a  MOOC  later  on. __label__0
But  the  clg  rookies  have  peaked  and  tsm  are  the  better  team  and  clg  got  lucky  and  can  only  play  split  push  and  are  completely  one  dimensional. __label__0
Yes  as  you  can  see  this  isn't  in  korea  and  the  o  in  apdo  has  a  little  apostrophe  on  it  so  we  know  this  can't  be  apdo __label__0
But  the  only  way  to  achieve  meaningful  gender  equality  is  by  enabling  men  to  be  able  to  fuck  whoever  they  want,  whenever  they  want,  just  like  women  can! __label__1
They  must  be  doing  well,  I  aven't  seen  anything  about  Libya  in  a  few  years  so  we  must  have  a  done  a  good  job  of  the  place. __label__1
He  made  the  courageous  and  self-realized  move  of  getting  a  drunk  blowjob  from  a  guy  he  knew  was  bisexual,  and  already  had  his  head  inches  from  his  crotch. __label__0
Way  to  stick  it  to  the  white  man..  If  Che  were  alive  he  would  beat  up  every  street  vendor  seeling  a  t-shirt  with  his  name  on  it! __label__1
Wait  a  minute...  The  4  Trail  Captains  +  Lillie  =  5...  Garnet  +  Amethyst  +  Pearl  +  Peridot  +  Lapis  =  5...  IT  ALL  COMES  TOGETHER... __label__1
Well  you  try  standing  on  a  raised  platform  in  a  cold  room  wearing  a  telly  tubby  mask  and  tell  me  how  big  you  dick  is  then. __label__0
Well,  considering  that  bitcoin  is  a  CIA  project  and  they  already  have  all  of  Satoshi's  stash,  I'd  say  no  because  they  already  have  5%  of  all  possible  coins. __label__1
Don't  you  know  that  if  Apple  isn't  doing  the  exact  same  things  that  it  was  when  Steve  Jobs  was  there  and  nothing  else,  they've  lost  focus? __label__1
This  game  showed  that  they  can  hang  in  there  and  scrape  out  the  win  in  a  close  game,  id  probably  move  them  up  to  2  tbh. __label__0
Nah,  best  to  take  all  morals  and  previous  learning  out  of  the  picture  and  let  rapists  free  because  a  piece  of  paper  says  we  are  supposed  to. __label__0
Too  much  work  I  just  want  to  brag  to  my  boys  how  big  and  badass  my  dog  is  and  beat  it  for  every  mistake  at  home  it  makes... __label__1
But  but  but,  the  prisoners  deserve  to  be  used  because  they  did  crime,  plus  they  get  paid  like  25  cents  a  day  so  it  isn't  slavery __label__1
Because  they  are  getting  a  better  deal  than  me  in  my  job,  therefore  I  begrudge  them  plus  I  had  to  catch  a  bus  instead  of  a  train  today __label__1
Because  madlife  predicting  exactly  where  people  would  flash  in  order  to  land  a  hook  was  clearly  thresh  being  op  and  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  player __label__0
Obviously  not  gay  bro,  you  really  think  a  guy  like  Steven  is  a  disgusting  sodamite...  Maybe  he  just  enjoys  sharing  his  kiddy  porn  with  his  preschool  wingman? __label__0
The  average  redditor  probably  wouldn't  date  me  because  I'm  a  woman  over  24  and  we  all  know  that's  when  women  become  living  Roombas  with  no  sex  appeal __label__0
Photo  is  *obviously*  fake,  SF  is  too  expensive  and  no  one  just  "has  a  dollar  just  in  their  pocket"  ready  to  use  for  scale  like  that. __label__1
Yeah,  don't  talk  about  it  with  other  people  who  might  be  able  to  share  some  insight  so  you  know  what  to  talk  to  your  doctor  about  exactly. __label__0
I  love  it,  totally  worth  getting  boosted  to  get  promoted  to  an  elo  where  you  lose  the  game  and  ruin  it  for  the  players  that  are  there  legitimately __label__0
Yeah,  removing  44  armor  from  a  champion  for  no  real  good  reason  other  than  an  item  overcompensating  AD  junglers  seemed  like  a  really  intelligent  move  at  the  time __label__0
Yeah  you  are  right,  I  suggest  we  start  nuking  the  sun  so  we  can  start  the  process  of  it  going  super  nova,  it's  all  pointless  anyway. __label__0
Yup  that's  why  they  called  a  bad  out  of  bounds  call  in  game  5,  and  specifically  zoomed  in  on  Kyrie's  Nike  Irving  2's...  for  the  $$ __label__0
The  best  part  is,  Regi  was  the  guy  that  DL  needed,  a  strong  man  that  can  hold  him  down  and  make  him  happy  at  the  same  time __label__1
Fuck  I've  been  gaming  at  1440p  on  a  gtx780  for  three  years  now,  no  one  ever  filled  me  in  on  it  not  being  a  1440p  card... __label__1
Because  obviously  the  first  picture  is  literally  the  moment  before  the  blast  and  there's  no  way  they  could  have  been  in  different  positions  when  it  actually  went  off. __label__1
well  YOU  try  making  a  living  raising  3  kids  as  a  minimum  wage  slave,  when  some  penny  pinching  personal  financier  only  tips  you  about  20%  gotta  make  those  ducats __label__1
We  don't  want  people  playing  it  just  for  the  cycle,  so  we're  raising  it  to  seven  mana  so  that  it  can't  be  used  with  cult  master. __label__1
The  most  ironical  thing:  The  decision  of  whether  to  'keep'  the  tiger  or  'let  it  go'  will  drag  on  the  files  for  years  -  may  be  decades. __label__1
Well  they  didn't  have  all  the  information  (only  some  of  the  pictures),  so  it's  better  to  just  look  at  the  pictures  ourselves  and  form  our  own  conclusions... __label__0
Marijuana  killed  2  people  in  the  history  of  the  world  and  it  happened  when  marijuana  is  starting  to  become  legal  stop  it  now  befive  it's  too  late __label__1
Why  would  I  do  that  when  the  optimal  way  to  farm  karma  is  to  flipflop  my  view  based  on  what  the  majority  in  a  thread  are  saying? __label__1
yeah,  they  also  didnt  know  what  germs  were  and  probably  defecated  in  holes,  but  supposedly  lived  5-10s  longer  than  us,  probably  all  the  "chemicals"  in  our  food __label__1
Yeah,  it's  not  like  we  actually  use  the  roads  or  public  schools  or  national  defense  or  any  of  the  other  hundred  things  our  tax  money  goes  toward. __label__1
"Eurghmergurd  he  only  did  two  keepy  uppies  before  vollying  it  in  the  first  video  -  sell  him  now,  get  him  this  cancer  out  of  our  club" __label__1
Well  I  mean  they  had  like  3  or  4  seconds  to  analyze  before  the  shock  wave  destroyed  their  house  so  that  should  be  plenty  of  time! __label__1
Forget  about  about  homosexuality,  personally  I  think  we  should  bring  back  stoning  to  death  of  Adulterers  and  punish  all  the  heathens  having  babies  out  of  wedlock... __label__1
If  I  only  have  Wi-Fi,  can  I  file  a  complaint  with  the  United  Nations  to  get  mobile  data  so  I  can  play  as  a  human  right? __label__0
Yes  but  next  year  is  the  Mayan  end-of-the-world  (really  just  the  end  of  a  cycle)  so  of  course  we  have  to  end  it  on  a  Christian  schedule __label__1
Because  if  someone  has  more  stuff  in  a  video  game  than  you,  it  must  be  because  you're  better  than  them  and  they  have  no  life  right? __label__0
I  mean,  you  just  need  to  get  some  wool,  rub  it  between  your  two  hands  till  you  get  a  string,  then  make  some  sort  of  beehive  looking  thing,  right? __label__1
How  dare  the  343  nonprofit  organization  make  a  purely  cosmetic  skin  and  charge  money  for  it  while  making  it  cost  a  ton  of  free  in  game  currency! __label__0
Dana  is  a  piece  of  shit,  he  is  bad  for  the  sport  and  the  only  reason  he  gave  them  the  money  is  because  it  was  being  filmed. __label__0
Conveniently  placed  on  the  boarder  with  mexico,  oh  no  that's  not  a  clever  sanctuary  for  the  immigration  laws  he  doesn't  want  to  enforce  nope  not  at  all. __label__0
I'm  not  sure  if  a  rocket  powered  robot  fucking  a  human  is  going  to  have  a  clean  aftermath  but  the  orgasm  will  be  fantastic  I'm  sure. __label__1
Well,  at  least  he's  going  to  kill  himself  after  he  gets  to  a  million,  so  we  don't  have  to  waste  any  time  being  concerned  for  the  next  999,996  women! __label__0
i  played  a  public  match  of  shadows  and  on  round  14  i  had  28  revives...  that  was  the  night  i  started  drinking  bleach  to  help  me  sleep __label__1
I  was  making  a  joke,  but  feel  free  to  continue  lecturing  me  about  my  profession;  I  love  being  talked  to  about  editing  and  directing  like  I'm  an  idiot. __label__1
Yes,  because  knowing  the  races  of  the  finalists  of  the  10  most  recent  premier  tournaments  is  the  only  knowledge  you  need  in  order  to  make  balance  decisions. __label__0
Yep,  all  those  millions  of  available  civilian  jobs,  combined  with  our  super  low  cost  of  education,  certainly  make  this  a  viable  option  for  so  many  of  our  Servicemen. __label__0
Well  I'm  just  really  concerned  that  there  might  be  some  rancid  xenophobia  in  there  that  you're  not  admitting  and  we  can't  have  there  in  my  city. __label__0
When  the  police  get  there,  be  sure  to  yell  "GUN"  repeatedly  and  loudly,  and  wave  your  gun  around  so  they  know  it's  you  who  is  armed. __label__0
I  also  feel  the  need  to  express  my  dominance  over  a  nice  person  who  shares  my  interests  because  I  am  also  a  sad  excuse  for  a  human. __label__1
Yes,  let  me  order  the  most  expensive  camera  and  assume  it  has  everything  I  want  instead  of  taking  two  minutes  to  look  at  what  features  it  actually  has. __label__1
Not  to  mention  that  SAO  is  the  best  one  out  there  and  Kirito  is  the  real  black  swordsman,  not  the  other  lame  guy,  what  was  his  name,  Bowels? __label__0
Nah,  there  must  be  100%  freedom  for  every  option  in  the  game  but  the  game  still  has  to  work  100%  well  and  it's  PGI's  fault  if  it  doesn't. __label__1
But  do  we  really  want  to  teach  "  you  have  3  apples,  and  because  you  are  a  shitty  businessman  you  now  owe  more  apples  than  you  own?" __label__1
The  only  released  when  it  starts  in  PST,  we  will  have  to  wait  until  they  announce  the  EST  release  time  since  it  is  impossible  to  convert  between  the  two __label__1
Since  when  is  it  not  okay  to  climb  over  the  wall  of  a  bathroom  stall  and  snap  a  picture  of  what's  going  on  on  the  other  side? __label__0
Right,  not  to  mention  that  when  they  die  they  go  to  paradise  and  get  72  virgins,  so  we  definitely  should  not  try  to  kill  the  terrorists. __label__1
Yeah,  but  random  redditors  says  that  it  runs  fine  on  their  Intel  HD2000,  so  really  I  think  they  are  just  butthurt  for  not  being  good  with  PC  gaming. __label__0
I  don't  know  what  you  are  complaining  about,  its  not  like  there  are  any  Pokemon  in  the  rural  areas  to  throw  the  pokeballs  at  any  way. __label__1
DUDE  YOU  CAN'T  JUST  GO  AND  TRY  TO  GET  PEOPLE  TO  PLAY  A  FUN  GAME  ON  A  PUBLIC  SETTING,  DO  YOU  WANT  TO  GET  BANNED  FROM  SCHOOL  TOO __label__0
Hey  if  we  have  to  mentally  and/or  physically  scar  a  few  people  to  bring  a  community  together  for  a  good  time,  then  I  think  its  worth  it! __label__1
Yeah,  let's  kick  him  out  for  a  guy  in  who's  going  to  bend  to  your  displeasure  and  go  back  to  not  adequately  funding  the  pension  system. __label__0
But  if  it's  the  most  difficult  in  the  US  it  must  be  the  most  difficult  in  the  world  since  US  is  the  best  country  in  everything! __label__0
Because  cops  mistakes  are  only  done  with  malice  and  they  could  never  have  good  intentions  and  doctors  mistakes  are  only  unfortunate  accidents  and  never  due  to  malice  or  incompetence. __label__0
Just  like  every  other  time  that  arms  get  parachuted  or  otherwise  fall  into  the  hands  of  whoever,  I'm  totally  sure  that  this  time  is  an  accident  as  well. __label__1
Yeah,  it  says  we  get  no  freedom  and  the  big  bad  government  is  going  to  spy  on  the  porn  that  we  watch  and  tell  our  mommies! __label__1
and  I  am  sure  the  Republicans  who  wasted  millions  of  dollars  having  a  thousand  investigations  over  Benghazi  will  be  sure  to  question  Comey  on  his  partisan  efforts __label__0
Damn  dude  you  should  publish  your  research  and  send  it  over  to  PBS  and  BBC,  let  them  know  that  you  figured  out  that  they're  all  wasting  their  time. __label__0
Oh  look  the  same  3  guys  we  see  now  all  acting  the  same  way  HAHA  SO  GOOD  but  they  only  got  better  so  now  they  all  suck. __label__1
Mass  child  rape  cases  and  cousins  marrying  as  a  statistic  will  always  track  I  suspect  but  don't  ever  raise  the  question  of  Islam  involvement  you  racist! __label__0
outsourcing  made  America  great  because  it  allowed  for  a  few  American  ceos  to  get  richer  because  americans  weren't  hard  enough  workers  and  didn't  know  how  to  suck  it  up. __label__0
ya,  kid  totally  deserves  jail..  that  or  maybe  just  cut  out  the  middle  man  and  let  a  cop  shoot  him  for  fear  of  being  run  over. __label__0
wasting  game  after  game  of  your  time  getting  stomped  on  is  actually  something  you  should  be  thankful  for,  because  playing  against  better  players  helps  you  improve  your  own  skill! __label__0
Being  too  tin,  it's  obvious  to  me  that  the  pro  obesity  moment  is  doing  good  work  on  combating  this  misogyny  but  some  people  are  just  too  dense __label__0
Yeah,  because  all  of  the  hotels,  restaurants,  and  casinos  are  just  going  to  shut  down  for  an  afternoon  because  all  their  employees  requested  the  day  off. __label__1
I  hate  it  when  companies  with  whom  I  have  an  existing  business  relationship  notify  me  when  I  am  using  their  service  of  other  aspects  of  their  service. __label__0
Yes,  but  believing  there  is  a  puppet  master  in  the  sky  who  has  planned  all  of  our  lives  for  us  makes  you  a  perfectly  rational  and  respectable  human. __label__0
yeah  well  intersectionlity  says  ur  rich  which  means  i  dont  care  about  hate  crimes  against  u  because  if  ur  not  oppressed  and  still  hated  it  must  be  justified __label__0
We  can't  allow  little  things  like  civil  liberties  stop  us  from  hunting  down  agents  of  the  ~~godless  communist~~  radical  islamic  terrorist  conspiracy,  no  matter  where  they  hide. __label__0
yeah  i  would  have  totally  preferred  to  watch  a  slow  game  with  8  kills  where  1  team  just  slowly  loses  the  game  without  any  fights  happening. __label__1
Cheering  is  the  uttering  or  making  of  sounds  encouraging,  stimulating  or  exciting  to  action,  indicating  approval  or  acclaiming  or  welcoming  persons,  announcements  of  events  and  the  like. __label__1
If  he  wants  to  keep  the  guns  realistic  he  should  just  ignore  left  handed  people,  like  the  gun  manufacturers  have  been  doing  for  hundreds  of  years. __label__0
"most  talented  surgeons  are  total  cunts"  Yeah  dude  I  can  tell  you  definitely  have  your  facts  straight  and  that  you  make  generalizations  that  aren't  full  of  shit. __label__0
It's  ok  though,  only  the  government  will  have  access  to  the  security  backdoors,  just  like  those  tsa  keys  for  baggage  that  totally  aren't  available  to  3d  print  now. __label__0
"I'm  comfortable  filling  the  most  glaring  hole  in  my  team  with  the  player  that  a  vast  majority  of  scouts  consider  the  best"  I  never  would  have  guessed __label__0
If  they  want  a  good  education  then  their  parents  shouldn't  have  made  bad  life  choices,  maybe  they  should  get  a  job  and  pay  for  their  own  socialistic  education. __label__1
Hm,  perhaps  he  was  asking  so  that  you  could  be  woo'd  by  his  orgasm-inducing  abilities  of  manliness  that  are  *far*  superior  to  anything  you've  ever  had  before. __label__0
Yeah,  because  NB  and  NS  both  need  another  50,000  poor  people  on  their  dime  so  that  people  in  Ontario  have  a  convenient  place  to  vacation  down  south. __label__0
I'm  just  saying,  I  don't  care  if  dragons  come  out  of  my  arrow  if  it  travels  so  slowly  some  dude  has  the  time  to  spawn  his  own  dragon. __label__0
You  should  be  ashamed  of  yourself  for  not  understanding  the  government  hates  you  and  is  part  of  a  mass  conspiracy  to  take  all  of  your  money  and  freedumb. __label__1
Especially  if  you  have  no  idea  why  you're  voting  and  have  no  desire  to  ever  know  the  policies  and  plans  of  the  person  you're  voting  for. __label__0
We  didnt  even  get  hair  spiking  up  when  we  go  super  saiyan  lol,  asking  for  mid  fight  fusion  is  far  beyond  the  capabilities  of  our  current  tech __label__0
well  duh  if  you  don't  hate  muslims  you  hate  the  lgbt  it  doesn't  take  a  massive  jump  to  get  to  that  conclusion  its  just  logic,  cuck. __label__0
He'd  get  her  in  a  rear  naked  choke  and  it'd  be  lights  out  in  under  15  secs,  not  sure  why  this  is  even  being  considered  as  an  even  fight... __label__0
But  they  need  100  round  magazines  and  armored  vehicles  so  that  we  can  prepare  for  the  inevitable  terrorist  invasion  (has  nothing  to  do  with  rise  of  fascism...) __label__0
Guess  that  explains  why  when  I  log  on  every  zone  in  the  game  is  a  ghost  town  and  the  main  campaign  is  always  empty  in  prime  time __label__1
I  don't  know,  if  he  drives  a  car  the  way  he  rides  a  bike,  I  think  I'd  rather  he  use  the  vehicle  that  causes  less  damage  to  other  people. __label__0
The  funny  thing  is  that  if  we  were  just  a  mile  closer  to  or  further  from  the  sun,  Earth  would  be  nothing  but  a  barren  wasteland. __label__1
As  I  understand  it,  you  have  total  human  rights  as  a  fetus,  which  you  completely  relinquish  at  birth  and  you  don't  get  them  back  until  you  turn  18. __label__1
At  this  point  i  just  want  to  see  americans  burn  their  country  down  before  Trump  even  gets  elected  and  then  Trump  will  issue  a  new  world  order __label__0
Yeah,  someone  has  a  different  opinion  as  me,  I  have  to  try  to  insult  him  because  I'm  the  only  one  who  is  allowed  to  be  right. __label__1
I  suppose  they'd  also  like  to  go  back  to  the  dark  ages  where  everything  was  done  by  candle  light,  cause  you  know  science  shouldn't  even  be  a  thing. __label__0
It  will  be  a  "per  publisher  decision"  whether  to  port  their  year  old  games  to  a  new  platform  or  not  so  not  all  hope  is  lost. __label__0
Well  as  we  know,  the  war  on  drugs  was  won  over  30  years  ago  and  since  then  we've  lived  in  a  world  with  very  little  drug  use. __label__0
Isn't  that  the  whole  point  of  Canada  aside  from  the  healthcare  and  me  helping  you  build  a  wall  to  keep  my  Trump-supporting  aunt  from  ruining  it? __label__0
Yes,  "international  thinkers,  government  advisors  and  Wall  Street  money-men"  are  exactly  who  I  expect  to  come  up  with  a  good  plan  for  "a  moral  and  just  society" __label__0
Oh  I  love  it,  sometimes  i  dont  see  it  the  first  time,  or  the  second  time,  but  that  third  and  fourth  time  really  helps  to  get  my  attention __label__0
Seeing  you  don't  need  a  valid  passport  to  board  an  international  flight  I  doubt  one  would  need  to  go  through  the  trouble  and  hide  inside  the  plane. __label__0
Can't  you  imagine  how  immersive  it  would  be  if  they  didn't  show  us  those  squares  and  we  just  clicked  on  an  area  and  hoped  it  was  a  square? __label__1
Yeah,  no  Value  town,  no  Deck  Wars  (or  maybe  by  different  team),  no  shows  from  other  games  -  but  at  least  people  got  their  wish  and  sapped  Chanman __label__1
Yeah  I  specifically  liked  the  part  where  they  gave  OP  a  citation  for  a  broken  window  and  overgrown  shrubbery  and  gave  the  junkie  a  ride  home  instead. __label__0
Well  then  it's  definitely  a  horrible  idea  to  add  more  density  there,  what  with  all  that  sexy  new  public  transit  just  a  hop  and  a  skip  away. __label__1
He's  saying  if  you  put  an  inordinate  amount  of  time  and  effort  building  something  you're  passionate  about  it  doesn't  make  you  cool,  just  a  try  hard. __label__0
all  you  mechanics  are  freakin  scammers,  you  could  have  just  given  him  a  tire  rotation  and  he  could  have  gotten  a  lot  more  ~~tread~~  skid  life  out  of  those. __label__0
How  can  we  claim  to  be  a  free  country  when  you  can't  even  stab  someone  and  then  refuse  to  submit  to  the  police  who  come  to  arrest  you? __label__0
I  went  from  playing  3  matches  every  day  to  about  1  every  3-4  day  so  yes,  they  dit  it,  the  length  of  matches  went  really  down... __label__1
While  we  are  removing  items  we  might  as  well  remove  anything  that  makes  champions  do  damage,  because  having  items  that  make  you  stronger  is  just  broken. __label__0
Yes  fire  the  whole  staff  and  cancel  the  season  for  the  rest  of  the  season  because  what  could  be  a  14  year  old  maybe  a  stupid  mistake. __label__1
Cause  if  I  were  going  to  pick  one  candidate  to  shoot  harambe  and  one  to  protect  him,  this  is  exactly  the  way  I  would  see  it  playing  out. __label__0
Shame  on  him  for  being  influenced  by  another  comic  and  then  having  the  audacity  to  make  his  own  unique  version  and  then  give  credit  and  link  to  the  original. __label__1
Uh  yeah  thats  why  Trump  said  he  would  overturn  gay  marriage  and  thats  why  Pence  has  a  proven  record  of  such  positivity  with  the  LGBT  community! __label__0
It's  admirable  if  you're  a  3  and  D  guy  in  the  league  but  it's  deplorable  that  DeAndre  Jordan  can  make  a  living  the  way  he  does. __label__0
OP  said  he  doesn't  like  double  barrelled  names  because  they're  'complicated',  Unlike  marriages,  which  are  all  smooth  and  easy  sailing  where  you  never  have  to  make  compromises __label__0
Yeah,  it  really  is  ridiculous  how  seahawk  fans  might  be  a  little  over  the  top  in  their  praise  for  Russell  when  they're  in  their  own  sub.... __label__1
i  got  into  a  league  crash  because  i  wasn't  watching  the  minimap  every  5  seconds  :L  league  ed  would  have  saved  a  life  and  a  match __label__0
Jokes  on  you  because  in  Bruce  Wayne's  birthday  party  in  batman  begins  there's  not  a  single  black  person  to  be  seen  on  camera  so  batman  is  racist! __label__0
Its  funny  because  I  am  a  reddit  fedora  and  I  never  get  a  raise  because  I  am  socially  awkward  and  I  like  to  blame  my  boss  for  it! __label__0
Yeah  with  980  ti  sli  if  you  don't  have  a  144hz  monitor  you're  fucked,  you'll  be  burning  through  a  monitor  a  week  easy  at  only  100hz __label__0
Git  gud  I  never  miss  CS  I  farm  all  3  lanes  and  both  jungles  if  you  can't  do  this  you  shouldn't  be  playing  meepo  GG  noob  meepo __label__0
When  I  look  at  my  children,  I  can't  wait  to  become  a  god  and  sacrifice  one  of  them  to  try  and  save  a  few  of  the  others. __label__1
I'm  really  looking  forward  to  being  able  to  complain  about  my  local  LCBOs  shitty  IPA  and  sour  beer  selection,  AS  WELL  AS  their  horrible  strains  of  indica. __label__0
Yes,  Samus  Aran  must  be  transgender  because  cis  women  can't  be  tall  Amazonian  warriors  oh  no  she  must  have  had  a  male  body  in  order  to  do  that. __label__1
Which  is  why  you  should  drive  as  fast  as  possible  when  drunk,  to  sober  up  from  the  rush  and  be  on  the  road  for  a  shorter  time! __label__0
It's  different  though,  because  Muslims  aren't  white  and  we  all  know  that  non-white  people  can't  be  held  to  the  same  standards  as  us  enlightened  white  people. __label__0
Yep,  targeting  a  specific  sub  and  making  up  arbitrary  rules  for  them  is  totally  cool  as  long  as  it  is  done  to  a  sub  I  disagree  with. __label__0
Thanks,  now  I  know  to  stay  away  from  cone  snails  and  bullet  ants  the  next  time  I'm  hiking  through  the  rain  forest  on  my  way  to  go  scuba  diving. __label__1
Not  if  she  irrationally  got  upset  because  they  withheld  SO  MUCH  MONEY  then  celebrated  when  she  got  a  fat  refund  check  from  the  government  around  tax  time. __label__0
Yeah,  because  all  women  who  want  children  are  crazy  bitches  who  try  to  lure  in  an  innocent  guy  who  doesn't  want  children  by  getting  pregnant  behind  his  back... __label__0
Well  that  makes  perfect  sense,  I  mean  chosen  by  god  means  they  have  the  most  upstanding  morals,  so  they  should  be  allowed  to  steal  from  heathens  all  they  want __label__0
That's  not  true,  I  once  saw  a  bunch  of  people  post  fb  statuses  about  how  they  didnt  allow  fb  to  use  their  info  in  whatever  manner __label__0
Yeah,  the  Palestinians  don't  fall  under  the  enemies  we're  supposed  to  love  or  the  least  of  these  or  those  who  are  naked,  poor,  unclothed,  sick,  or  in  prison. __label__1
I'm  officially  if  the  j  rob  bandwagon...  Fuckin  idiot  this  will  be  fun  to  deal  with  for  the  next  decade...  Cool  though  we  got  some  lineman __label__1
This  kind  of  makes  sense..  I  don't  know  if  stopping  a  bad  guy  is  a  good  idea  though....  having  some  sort  of  defense  mechanism  might  be  too  manly. __label__1
Uh,  no,  bro,  we  have  to  throw  a  fit  about  it  and  block  them  even  if  it  makes  them  wreck  because  road  rage  affects  everyone  but  me. __label__0
Sorry  some  people  don't  know  some  matchups  because  they  haven't  been  playing  that  long,  I  guess  you  shouldn't  be  allowed  to  comment  if  you're  a  new  player __label__0
I  swear  to  god,  if  this  were  American  police,  everybody  would  be  absolutely  tearing  them  to  shreds,  but  no,  this  is  British  police,  so  it's  perfectly  excusable __label__0
Because  nobody  genuinely  likes  webpages  and  the  deals  posted  by  them  and  wishes  to  recommend  others  to  go  there,  only  doing  so  when  they  themselves  are  paid. __label__1
Of  course,  just  like  Ant-Man  and  Guardians  of  the  Galaxy,  this  will  prove  once  again  that  audiences  only  watch  the  MCU  for  RDJ  and  Chris  Evans/Hemsworth. __label__1
Er...  Well  TECHNICALLY  MY  POST  THAT  WAS  DOWNVOTED  TO  HELL  WAS  AN  AU  CALLED  UNDERFAIL  AND  THAT  MEANS  THIS  GOES  AGAINST  COPYRIGHT  AND  YOU  SUCK  AND  MEEEH __label__1
Wow...way  to  put  forth  a  unbiased  opinion,  and  to  leave  out  key  parts  of  the  research...  Great  article  that  doesn't  mention  any  of  the  products  tested  in  the  research __label__0
Yeah,  the  hype  has  been  dead  a  long  time  ago,  there's  only  5-10  post  a  day  about  sombra  now,  nobody  remember  her,  and  nobody  care  anymore __label__1
downvotes  don't  go  far  enough,  what  if  that  terrible  hate  speech  got  upvotes,  think  about  all  the  people  that  could  be  triggered  and  feel  unsafe  because  of  it. __label__1
NO,  because  my  religion  has  a  very  narrow  interpretation  of  how  god  wants  us  all  to  be  and  so  they  must  conform  to  my  rules  because  god  said  so.... __label__0
No,  it's  okay  for  fat  people  to  make  fun  of  other  fat  people,  like  how  blacks  can  call  other  blacks  the  N  word  but  no  one  else  can. __label__1
Well,  what  else  are  they  supposed  to  do  when  the  are  being  oppressed  so  much  that  they  can't  keep  their  sectarian  prayer  hanging  up  on  government  property? __label__0
[I  thought  this  Jaina  is  a  Dreadlord  was  just  a  little  joke,  but  after  doing  the  Alliance  starting  experience  in  the  Beta  I  really  think  she  might  be.] __label__1
As  a  16  year  old  I  will  have  you  know  I  am  actually  in  college  and  I  have  an  IQ  of  267  and  4  Masters  Degrees... __label__0
Hunting  over  bait  -  because  it  takes  a  lot  of  skill  to  wait  for  the  deer  to  walk  into  the  crosshairs  before  you  pull  the  trigger. __label__0
Oh  man  you  got  me,  a  political  discussion  in  the  capitol  held  on  the  taxpayers  dime,  this  is  a  once  in  a  life  time  deal  right  here! __label__0
Sure  and  of  course  all  victim  blaming  occurs  only  by  males,  is  entirely  the  norm  and  therefore  it's  entirely  appropriate  to  use  wholesale  misandry  to  point  that  out. __label__1
because  "men"  who  have  sex  with  thin  women  are  actually  pedophiles  something  something  real  men  are  into  real  women  something  something  meat  on  their  bones  something  something __label__1
Don't  you  know  that  the  poor  immigrants  deserve  to  go  to  school  and  if  the  school  denies  them  then  they  need  to  check  their  white  privilege? __label__0
Yes  when  I  hear  free  open  opinion  the  first  thing  I  want  is  for  it  to  be  stifled  and  hidden  under  a  rock  not  being  heard  anywhere. __label__0
If  you  can't  explain  the  difference  between  a  fixed-rate  and  adjustable  rate  mortgage  to  a  4  year  old,  you're  clearly  a  terrible  parent  and  should  have  been  sterilized. __label__1
Nah,  Perkz  is  a  piece  of  shit  and  he  should  get  about  90%  of  all  the  blame  with  the  rest  of  the  blame  going  to  Ocelote. __label__1
Lucky  you  :&lt;  Apparently  it's  meant  to  make  the  woman  want  to  seek  your  approval,  because  as  we  all  know  what  all  women  really  want  most  is  male  approval __label__0
Educate  yourself  shitlord,  black  people  never  do  anything  wrong  ever,  and  when  black  people  are  seen  committing  crimes,  it's  always  just  a  white  person  in  black  face. __label__0
I  seriously  thought  you  were  still  trolling  (albeit  poorly),  but  apparently  that  really  is  the  underlying  message...  So  fucking  rich,  keep  it  on  man,  it  looks  GREAT! __label__0
Oh  my  god  who  thought  that  apple  would  release  the  iphone  5s  in  September,  it's  not  like  they  have  been  doing  it  for  the  last  two  years. __label__1
I  don't  know  about  you,  but  when  I  want  my  car  back  in  an  hour  I'll  wait  *at  least*  a  week  before  I  text  the  person  again. __label__0
Reddit  is  a  hub  of  people  from  all  ages  and  ranges  of  smarts,  therefore  it  would  be  wise  to  ask  reddit  before  most,  if  not  all  real  life  decisions! __label__0
Man  why  does  the  south  have  such  a  hate  against  people  who  shit  on  them  and  call  them  scum  man  I  just  can't  figure  it  out __label__1
And  the  Government  will  for  sure  put  out  the  gathered  data  for  everyone  to  see  if  it  shows  that  different  groups  of  people  have  different  IQ. __label__0
You  mean  people  who  don't  take  care  for  their  health  are  also  more  likely  to  not  take  care  of  their  teeth,  I  would  have  never  guessed. __label__0
Right,  because  protests  that  had  hundreds  of  thousands  to  millions  of  people  involved  are  the  same  as  the  current  protest  of  20,000  pissed  off  college  students  nation  wide __label__1
Yea,  hell  why  even  teach  history  in  schools  no  one  needs  that  old  history  lesson  to  see  how  we  have  gotten  to  where  we  are  today __label__1
I'm  sure  that  1-2  degree  difference  in  50  years  will  be  the  death  of  us  all  and  humanity  wont  be  able  to  use  technology  to  cope __label__1
Farage  thinks  that  Germany  and  France  will  launch  an  invasion  of  Britain  if  the  UK  leaves  the  EU  so  that's  why  he  wants  to  increase  military  spending. __label__0
Luckily  the  American  education  system  resolves  that  problem  so  the  average  American  is  knowledgable  about  the  rest  of  the  world  with  its  vastly  ranging  cultures,  languages  and  idiosyncrasies. __label__0
Since  Intel  has  been  calling  their  processors  with  prime  numbers  (Core  2  quad,  Core  i3,  i5,  i7),  the  next  should  be  the  i11  and  the  i13. __label__0
Right,  because  literally  every  single  wireless  AV  technology  works  the  same  way,  which  is  why  there's  no  need  for  dedicated  hardware  like  a  Steam  Link  to  even  exist __label__1
Yup,  because  it's  not  possible  that  people  who  have  been  together  long  enough  to  decide  to  get  married  could  possibly  be  in  agreement  about  children,  or  lack  thereof. __label__1
Iove  hearing  people  say  "there's  always  a  job  opening  at  McDonald's"  Motherfucker,  I  know  there's  a  job  there  but  I'd  rather  be  a  piece  of  shit. __label__0
not  really,  he  wrote  something(not  to  big)  back  in  the  early  70s,  when  he  was  not  busy  helping  the  civil  rights  movement  in  Chicago  i  mean,  you  forgot  the __label__0
Oh,  I  agree  with  skeptics  in  general  when  they  say  there's  no  evidence  for  god,  but  those  New  Skeptics  are  making  everything  worse  for  the  rest  of  us. __label__1
Well  clearly  because  he's  a  special  snowflake  he  deserves  to  beat  that  guy,  it's  the  non-cheater's  fault  for  not  knowing  that  exploiting  is  required  in  the  dark  zone...duh. __label__0
I  enjoy  playing  with  people  that  never  talk  or  call  out  anything  but  only  when  you're  the  last  man  standing  and  they  start  complaining  about  you  playing  bad. __label__0
This  is  clearly  a  positive  externality,  and  so  his  neighbors  should  be  taxed  to  subsidize  him  so  that  he  produces  the  socially  optimal  amount  of  BBQ  smell. __label__0
Ah,  so  the  obvious  choice  to  reform  into  a  communist  nation,  where  things  like  crime  do  not  exist  and  therefore  the  need  of  police  is  obviated. __label__0
It  will  be  sensible,  and  it  will  be  British  and  much  better  than  what  Johnny  Foreigner  has  to  offer...  you  can  almost  hear  Elgar  playing  in  the  background __label__0

Yes,  lets  leave  it  to  the  Walton  family  to  determine  that  their  kids  deserve  $42  billion  each,  but  "some  people"  (a.k.a  their  employees)  don't  deserve  a  living  wage. __label__0

Yes,  because  to  let  a  potentially  good  HC  go  to  another  team  because  we  sat  on  our  hands  waiting  to  hire  a  GM  first  is  such  a  goooood  idea! __label__0
B-b-b-but  in  Star  Trek  they  can  time  travel  whenever  they  want  cuz  Kirk  did  it  twice  by  slingshotting  around  the  sun  and  totally  didn't  make  plot  holes __label__0

And,  God  forbid,  if  you  get  in  a  car  accident,  your  car  will  be  covered  while  your  internal  injuries  can  wait  until  you  decide  to  get  health  insurance... __label__0
Too  bad  there  isn't  an  easily  accessible  place  with  lots  of  information  people  can  go  to  to  find  out  more  about  their  conditions,  treatment  options  and  medication  risks/benefits. __label__1
Let's  celebrate  2016  that  won't  include  any  real  things  to  celebrate  about:  no  LRT  yet,  no  downtown  hockey  arena,  no  new  downtown  library,  just  a  few  Syrian  refugees! __label__0
Everything  is  clear  now,  all  the  complaints  and  whining  about  shipping  posted  here  are  actually  scalpers  who  dont  know  what  to  say  to  their  buyers  ! __label__1
If  you  buy  anything  in  America  you  are  complicit  in  running  a  Chinese  sweatshop  and  the  blood  of  all  workers  there  who  have  committed  suicide  is  on  your  hands! __label__1
Yeah  you're  right  Turbo  Wii  sounds  lame...  They  should  just  call  it  Wii  D  to  fit  with  the  3D  craze,  then  I  can  just  call  it  Wiid.... __label__0
No,  no,  no,  you  see  last  time  we  put  a  corrupt  dictator  in  power  with  only  one  or  two  words,  but  our  new  *three*  word  ideology  changes  everything! __label__0
Yea  America  never  pushes  other  countries  around  it  always  keeps  to  itself  and  remains  neutral  on  the  global  stage  without  trying  to  impose  it's  own  agenda  on  anyone. __label__0
Because  people  were  complaining  that  they  were  held  without  any  reasonable  cause  and  that  it  was  unethical,  demanding  that  they  be  released...  that  turned  out  great,  didn't  it? __label__0
Well  of  course  I  can  sell  this  old  laptop  with  a  smashed  motherboard  and  a  hard  drive  full  of  malware  from  questionable  porn  sites  for  a  new  phone! __label__0
Nah  Bro,  this  cunts  gonna  look  at  his  ankle  and  be  like,  WHY  THE  FUCK  DID  I  GET  THIS  HILARIOUS  TATTOO  in  line  10  years  I  guarantee  it. __label__1
No,  there  are  specific  rules  when  you  can  and  cannot  rush  the  court  and  if  you  don't  follow  the  rules  you  and  your  fans  are  giant  turdnuggets! __label__1
It's  just  a  minor  visual  bug  guys,  just  wait  untill  they  fix  all  the  major  bugs  and  we  get  out  of  the  beta,  after  that  you  can  complain. __label__0
Yes  because  that's  clearly  the  solution  for  any  problem  you  might  have,  and  not  for  revenge  and  personal  satisfaction  arising  from  it  or  anything  like  that,  right? __label__0
No,  but  you  see,  for  a  female  action  character  to  be  good  at  what  she  does,  she  has  to  completely  abandon  any  sense  of  emotion  or  humanity __label__1
Nah  mate  but  Malcolm  Turnbull  waved  his  Ipad  around  and  said  we  don't  need  the  NBN  coz  wireless  something  something  heaps  quick  something  something  taxpayer  waste  carbon  tax. __label__0
You  can't  possible  expect  refugees  from  Muslim  nations  to  be  held  to  the  same  scrutiny  as  the  Italians,  Irish,  Germans,  Chinese,  Japanese,  Vietnamese,  Cubans,  etc  etc  It's  2016! __label__1
Umm,  actually  the  worst  case  scenario  is  you  fuck  up  the  timings,  voltage,  and  multiplier  so  much  it  fries  your  entire  system...but  you  know,  OC  is  "idiot  proof" __label__0
So  does  that  mean  the  whole  Pixar  Theory  did  and  superheroes,  monsters  and  magic  exist  and  our  emotions  are  caused  by  tiny  beings  in  our  head? __label__0
And  since  every  release  of  Office  for  Mac  has  been  both  right  on  time  compared  to  its  counterparts,  and  exceptionally  functional  and  a  dramatic  improvement,  it'll  be  great! __label__0
lol,  it  will  be  balanced  by  the  fact  that  by  the  time  you  wait  for  5  sec  needed  for  lock  the  infantry  will  have  already  shotgunned  you. __label__1
The  obvious  answer  is  that  there's  no  such  thing  as  lesbians,  and  any  girl  who  claims  to  be  one  is  just  hopping  onto  the  LBGT  bandwagon  for  attention __label__1
The  guys  up  top  have  to  finance  yachts  and  summer  homes  though,  they  can't  waste  money  on  bs  like  cafeteria  staff  so  the  peons  are  "comfortable"  geez. __label__0
step  1)  write  a  bunch  of  shit  step  2)  go  to  cyper  step  3)  spit  written  shit  step  4)  don't  let  anyone  know  you  wrote  it  beforehand __label__0
Yes,  this  makes  complete  sense,  because  when  people  go  on  a  shooting  rampage,  everyone  immediately  charges  the  shooter  to  grab  the  weapons  instead  of  running  for  cover.... __label__0
When  you  are  competing  for  dollars  and  positive  yelp  reviews  from  the  discerning  pedo,  branding  might  be  all  that  helps  you  stand  out  in  that  area. __label__0
Because  there  is  only  one  way  of  implementing  a  more  social  ownership  of  the  means  of  production  and  thats  the  way  it  was  implemented  in  your  country. __label__0
But  it  makes  complete  sense  that  you  can  carry  twice  as  much  in  a  backpack  than  you  can  store  in  a  massive  crate  in  the  BoO. __label__0
Yeah,  seeing  an  old  man  mistakenly  shot  makes  me  want  to  go  down  to  my  local  police  station  and  target  shoot  as  many  cops  as  I  can. __label__1
Wow,  that  was  such  an  amazingly  logical  and  coherent  thought,  you've  made  me  change  my  opinion  almost  instantaneously,  well  done  for  your  well  though  out  argument __label__0
I  geuss  the  devs  didnt  expect  anyone  to  be  allies  with  the  Terrans  for  them  to  implement  a  friendly  warning  text  in  this  version  of  EA __label__0
Looks  like  a  white  fat  guy  from  the  photos..  damn  what  have  this  world  become  to,  when  even  white  people  can  stab  someone  in  bright  daylight __label__0
Thank  god  someone  is  taking  a  stand,  these  male  panhandlers  with  all  their  privilege  and  benefiting  from  institutional  misogyny  have  had  an  easy  ride  for  too  long! __label__1
That  flesh  and  bread  are  both  made  up  of  nothing  more  than  protons,  neutrons,  and  electrons,  so  any  differences  between  them  really  just  come  down  to  personal  interpretation. __label__1
Hey,  there's  this  RGIII  fella  who  will  likely  be  available...should  we  trade  a  pick  for  him  to  make  sure  we  can  lock  him  up  before  the  market  does? __label__0
I  don't  understand  why  he's  opposed  to  the  leash  when  he's  perfectly  willing  to  crate  her  like  a  puppy  to  keep  her  away  from  the  Christmas  tree. __label__1
Yeah,  credit  card  companies  hire  people  to  look  at  individual  purchases  of  people  and  if  you've  never  bought  a  lingerie  before  they  know  it  isn't  really  you! __label__0
But  don't  you  know  that  calling  other  side  "the  enemy  you  are  most  proud  off"  is  the  best  way  to  get  something  done  in  bipartisan  way? __label__0
I  was  going  to  do  a  "my  mom  came  into  my  room"  joke  but  she  is  voting  Clinton,  so  after  tomorrow  she  is  dead  too  me! __label__1
If  they  focus  their  strategy  on  14-18  year  old  millennials,  they  should  have  the  disposable  income  and  proper  cultural  mindset  by  the  time  things  get  underway. __label__0
I'm  confident  that  when  you  discuss  this  with  your  buddies,  you'll  characterize  this  as  a  discussion  between  an  American  and  yourself,  not  between  a  Jew  and  yourself. __label__0
I  wonder  if  a  screengrab  from  this  video  will  be  included  on  the  news  report  of  this  kid  killing  a  bunch  of  people  because  of  this  game. __label__0
You're  such  a  genius,  you  just  debunked  all  the  greatest  mysteries  of  life,  I  don't  know  how  you  managed  to  come  to  such  an  amazing  realization,  wow,  bravo. __label__0
You  need  to  draw  cats  like  kids  do:  4  feet  and  all  of  them  are  on  the  same  side  cause  otherwise  it'd  look  like  it  had  2  feet. __label__0
Glad  you  were  able  to  glean  their  entire  personal  situation  from  the  tiny  little  article  you  read  the  title  of  and  made  a  well  informed  judgment  call! __label__0
It  because  modern  moral  ethical  codes  are  from  the  devil  and  we  should  go  back  to  the  times  where  women  and  other  non-self  races  can  be  treated  as  property. __label__0
Was  supposed  to  be  tongue  in  cheek  because  there's  so  many  posts,  but  I  mean  I  guess  it's  hard  for  some  people  to  see  sarcasm  without  the __label__0
Wow,  I  guess  I  should  return  my  portable  i3+970  rig  that's  as  big  as  a  PS4  (and  3-4x  as  powerful  as  one)  and  buy  a  console  instead __label__0
Yeah,  I  saw  a  guy  talking  about  babkers  getting  raises  from  bailout  money,  because  bailouts  are  free  money  and  not  emergency  loans  that  were  paid  back  with  interest __label__0
If  Tupac  came  back  to  life  Lil  Wayne  would  suddenly  loose  all  his  money  and  fans  and  then  no  one  would  hire  him  because  of  his  face  tattoos. __label__0
If  you  don't  mind  being  an  option  and  allowing  your  gf/wife  to  have  sex  with  other  guys,  then  you  should  do  whatever  it  takes  to  stay  with  her. __label__0
It  would  be  really  good  if  you  could  use  your  trinket  on  someone  like  malphite  and  not  allow  him  to  use  his  ultimate  on  10  secs __label__0
Maybe  they  could  let  your  Zombies  pick  up  loot,  identify  it,  vendor  the  trash  ones,  and  put  the  rest  in  a  shop  forum  thread  too  8). __label__0
They  are  way  to  powerful  to  invade,  so  let's  leave  them  out  of  it  and  focus  on  the  countries  we  can  control  and  take  over  the  governments  of  yeah? __label__0
No,  but  you  see,  Cormier  is  getting  closer  to  40,  and  there  is  an  inverse  proportion  between  T/E  and  age  as  you  start  getting  closer  to  40. __label__0
Totally  understandable  you  friend  had  ounces  of  a  marijuana  which  could  cause  him  to  get  reefer  madness  and  sit  on  the  couch  for  an  hour  or  so. __label__0
Dude,  if  you  aren't  going  to  lap  their  ass  and  claim  every  match  as  a  potential  MOTY,  I  just  don't  think  there's  room  for  you  in  this  sub. __label__0
Fuck  EA  I  want  a  Frost  Pack  they  stole  from  me  those  assholes  and  gave  other  people  more  of  a  chance  to  pull  all  those  ghosts  and  presents __label__1
Because  posting  a  lost  cat  picture  in  hopes  of  signaling  a  family  who  misses  their  pet  needs  to  be  in  high  quality  or  else  it's  useless. __label__1
Yeah,  I'd  hate  to  see  Star  Wars  taken  away  from  Lucas's  artistic  vision  to  turn  it  into  a  cheap  brand  to  cash  in  on  at  every  opportunity. __label__1
Also  ISIS  is  an  intelligence  agency  in  Archer,  which  is  full  of  people  fucking  and  drinking.They  absolutely  must  change  the  name  now.Lest  they  be  associated  with  such  debaucherous  acts. __label__1
Yeah,  having  the  bottom  half  of  the  audio  spectrum  isn't  a  necessity,  you're  only  losing  a  big  chunk  of  your  music  since  your  speakers  can't  reproduce  those  frequencies. __label__0
I  would  say  you  should  wait  for  a  bit  of  a  bigger  sale,  the  game  doesn't  have  enough  content  in  my  opinion  in  order  to  be  worth  it. __label__1
I  supposed  not  closing  it  and  just  having  police  block  the  intersection  for  the  procession  and  letting  traffic  backup  onto  315  would  be  a  better  alternative.... __label__1
Why,  so  the  western  media  can  once  again  chide  India  for  not  spending  the  same  money  building  toilets  first  and  taking  all  that  $300  Million  aid  from  UK. __label__0
And  the  threats,  and  the  doxing,  and  calling  people  at  their  jobs  and  getting  them  fired,  and  sending  people  syringes....  Some  real  first-class  people,  those  AntiGG  types. __label__0
Ah,  but  he  said  *interested  in*  money,  not  necessarily  possessing  money,  and  I  assume  you're  interested  in  money  since  you  don't  have  it,  so  you  proved  him  right! __label__0
He's  given  so  much  evidence  as  the  public  figure  he's  been  his  entire  adult  life,  not  just  during  this  bid  for  the  presidency,  that  he  wouldn't  be  corrupt. __label__0
I  accidentally  let  that  [Wrothian  that  storms  a  Ganglion  base  solo  die,  because  I  didn't  know  there  was  a  red  item  orb  nearby  that  saves  her  :(] __label__1
Oh  pins  yea  I  just  shove  my  finger  In  and  press  them  down  and  pick  up  the  board  by  only  the  socket  right  without  a  cover  right __label__1
B-but  he's  a  ~~nig~~  ghetto  thug  who  only  raps  about  guns  unlike  this  SHINING  POET  of  a  man  I  only  just  discovered  in  a  YouTube  video! __label__0
Give  it  a  few  weeks  and  there's  a  chance  that  the  UK  wont  be  eligible  for  the  Euros  anyway  so  I  don't  see  what  the  problem  is. __label__1
Math  smath,  someone  told  me  a  myth  debunked  multiple  times  so  I'm  going  to  stick  my  head  in  the  sand  and  vote  for  corporate  stooges  because  Nader __label__0
Yeah  I'm  sure  her  grandchildren  will  appreciate  your  sentiment,  as  it  is  true  that  she  is  still  like  this  today  and  people  aren't  capable  of  change. __label__0
Unless  they  have  a  vagina,  then  apparently  they  lucked  into  the  situation  and  didn't  have  to  deal  with  the  "Real"  training  the  ones  with  penises  go  through. __label__0
Well  you  could  just  attach  the  lease  agreement  to  your  bonnet,  you'll  probably  be  so  close  up  someone  else's  arse  they'd  be  able  to  read  it  clearly. __label__0
Yeah,  didn't  you  guys  know,  this  new  legislature  said  that  the  gays  can  totally  get  married  now,  but  people  who  are  attracted  to  more  than  one  gender  can't. __label__1
All  the  Jews  that  could  pay  there  way  out  of  Germany  had  capital  meaning  the  Jews  as  a  race  got  richer,  think  of  all  the  good  Hitler  did __label__0
If  you  order  a  t-shirt  now  you  gotta  pay  for  fast  shipping,  otherwise  he's  gonna  be  on  another  team  by  the  time  it  gets  to  your  house  lol __label__0
I  for  one  look  forward  to  the  day  I  can  take  my  kids  trick  or  treating  and  then  put  them  to  bed  and  go  to  the  midnight  sales. __label__1
A  woman  was  a  victim  of  abuse,  but  the  real  tragedy  here  is  that  a  Nice  Guy  didn't  get  the  sex  he  deserved  until  he  was  19  years  old. __label__0
Because  if  you  don't  have  skills,  really  you  *should*  starve  to  death,  because  you  don't  really  deserve  to  live....  why  pay  a  living  wage  to  an  unskilled  worthless  person? __label__1
This  is  another  set  of  'unfortunate  mistakes'  that  she  is  learning  from...  This  helps  make  her  the  best  candidate  ever  since  she  is  learning  soo  much.. __label__0
But  she  needs  all  the  makeup  because  of  society's  high  standards  of  beauty  for  women  which  we  all  know  is  only  to  serve  men's  hunger  for  sex. __label__0
Yeah  but  that's  not  technically  a  "no,"  that's  why  the  euro  girls  are  best  because  they  just  say  "nyet"  or  "nein"  or  "nej"  and  never  "no." __label__1
Yes  are  you  kidding  that's  going  to  encourage  women  to  step  out  of  the  kitchen  we  can't  have  that,  a  lead  role  is  for  a  male __label__0
If  high  school  taught  me  anything,  its  that  attractive  people  are  always  nice  and  if  they  aren't  nice  to  you  its  your  fault  for  being  such  a  nerd. __label__0
How  dare  he  do  his  job  and  ask  questions  that  are  relevant  and  give  us  insight  into  what  happened  during  the  fight,  oh  no  so  offensive  and  mean. __label__1
yeah  pretending  he's  actually  a  super  hero  seems  like  a  way  better  idea  than  actually  telling  the  kid  he  can  be  hurt  by  bullets  because  superheroes  aren't  real. __label__0
I  bet  all  my  skins  that  you  are  the  first  person  with  that  problem  and  you  can't  find  a  single  answer  by  using  the  search  function. __label__0
Nah  man  if  Riot  did  it  it  must  be  bad  and  it  is  our  job  to  complain  about  it  make  things  up  if  you  have  to __label__0
Well  I  would  rather  like  to  think  AAP  as  a  BJP  agent  since  what  AAP  is  actually  doing  by  abusing  Modi  and  BJP  is  eating  away  Congress  votes. __label__0
I  see  why  he  drops  it  for  his  stage  name,  but  I  mean  that's  his  real  name  so  he  should  stop  pretending  to  be  something  he's  not. __label__1
Wow,  Big  Brother  must  hire  quite  the  team  of  writers  to  script  24-hour  live  feeds  for  three  months  (usually  with  different  cameras  going  in  two  different  rooms). __label__0
Yeah,  I  hate  when  pretentious  assholes  make  a  friendly  suggestion  and  I  end  up  discovering  something  that  I  never  knew  about  and  end  up  really  liking  it! __label__1
Having  secure  borders,  knowing  who  comes  and  goes  in  your  country,  and  deporting  people  where  illegally  makes  you  a  racist  and  means  you  are  against  all  immigration. __label__1
I  dont  think  so,  the  long-ranged  scanners  will  bring  you  down,  i  think  you  might  have  been  able  to  do  it  if  you  had  an  automated  reloader  instead __label__0
Hey,  let's  make  an  app  1.2B  people  per  month  will  use,  and  will  generate  almost  4B  in  revenue  every  3  months  and  NOT  protect  the  binary  from  reverse  engineering! __label__1
She  has  a  lady  brain  though  which  is  only  two  thirds  the  size  of  a  mans  brain  -  obviously  science  is  going  to  be  too  hard  for  her __label__1
Oh,  come  on,  you  know  we  all  want  201%  They  only  last  a  day,  and  the  next  set  of  resonators  deployed  decays  instantly,  to  pay  off  the  debt. __label__0
That  would  have  been  kind  of  tough  for  her  to  do  considering  she's  based  in  NYC  and  the  rest  of  Reddit's  admins  are  based  in  the  Bay  Area. __label__1
And  how  dare  us  retail  staff  complain  about  wanting  to  go  home  at  the  end  our  working  day  on  time  when  we're  getting  all  that  overtime. __label__1
But  how  else  am  I  and  my  pro  group  who  only  play  dps  supposed  to  shit  talk  my  horrible  team  that  holds  us  back  every  match? __label__0
Why  buy  aghs  for  a  12  second  cooldown  when  you  could  buy  refresher  for  only  600  more  and  have  a  0  second  cooldown  and  have  double  battery  assault? __label__0
But  don't  you  know  its  rude  not  to  become  immediately  attracted  to  and  fuck  some  guy  just  because  he's  psychologically  manipulating  you  by  pretending  to  be  your  friend... __label__0
Yeah,  what  an  idiot  he  is  for  having  a  conversation  with  the  future  president  about  topics  that  matter  to  him  and  trying  to  make  a  change. __label__0
Yeah  I  mean,  if  I  had  a  chance  to  play  with  one  of  the  best  players  of  all  time  (Lemieux)  again,  I  would  want  out  too. __label__1
cuz  east  needs  to  be  united,  because  we  could  see  last  years  that  their  lack  of  union  with  every  other  eastern  region  made  them  lose  every  international  event! __label__1
Maybe  he  was  having  visions  of  his  past  life  as  a  gladiator  in  the  arena  and  thought  the  pillow  fight  was  a  fight  to  the  death. __label__0
never  looked  at  them  as  "scorecards,"  but  holy  shit  that's  so  true...  "Become  a  suicidal  mass  murderer  and  CNN  will  show  how  well  u  did  compared  to  your  predecessors!" __label__0
if  it  didnt  load  for  all,  the  game  wont  start  and  the  person  who  didnt  loaded  in  time  will  be  banned  from  league  ...  easy  as  that __label__1
Well  duh  if  you  make  life  easier  on  Stafford,  it  means  you  don't  want  it  as  hard  as  possible  for  him,  therefore  you  don't  have  confidence  in  him __label__0
Yeah  he  clearly  didn't  have  tons  of  mental  problems  that  landed  him  in  psychiatric  care  nah  he  was  there  for  fun  it's  2016  come  on  guys __label__1
It  just  goes  to  show  you,  you  can  have  all  the  keys  to  success  right  there  in  front  of  you,  and  still  chose  to  be  a  loser... __label__0
It  wasn't  their  book  it  was  their  dads.....  You're  definitely  on  the  right  side  if  you're  throwing  out  the  opposing  sides  books  that  isn't  even  your  property __label__0
Well  of  course  he  said  that,  he  read  our  comments  on  the  other  thread  and  said  ,"  yea,  I  do  deserve  some  time  off  to  recover!" __label__0
Yeah  I  also  agree  with  all  these  bronzies  with  a  Master  Yi  flair  who  are  totally  NOT  biased  and  know  exactly  what  they  are  talking  about. __label__0
Of  course,  because  women  totally  can't  be  simply  friends  with  men,  every  guy  they  know  HAS  to  have  a  dating-rank  of  some  sort  that  they  should  feel  aware/insecure  about... __label__1
But  what  about  the  bleeding  hearts  that  think  the  killers  pedos  and  rapists  still  have  rights  and  should  be  treated  fairly.....we  have  to  accommodate  the  bleeding  hearts  don't  we __label__0
Peta  has  been  around  lately  bothering  the  tiger  guy  in  Bowmanville  ..  maybe  you  can  get  them  to  come  visit  Toronto  and  harass  TPS  about  the  mounted  unit. __label__0
I  find  it  rather  amusing  that  she  has  too  much  pride  to  find  a  lower-paying  job,  but  not  so  much  that  she  minds  sponging  off  of  you. __label__0
Then  why  do  liberal  college  professors  teach  that  it  was  about  slavery  and  how  all  the  wrongs  in  the  world  were  caused  by  the  evils  of  white  males? __label__0

Yes,  because  secretly  we  did  send  everyone  of  our  80  million  citizens  to  boot  camp,  so  that  when  we  rise  on  21st  December,  2012...  we  will  crush  everyone. __label__1
Yeah,  but  how  awesome  must  it  be  to  be  able  to  tell  people  you  meet  in  real  life  that  you're  kind  of  a  big  deal  on  the  internet? __label__0

If  there's  one  thing  I've  learned  from  reddit  it's  that  you  should  take  social  advice  from  it  and  if  there's  conflicting  things  comments  just  take  the  highest  voted  one __label__0
Well,  I  mean  there's  a  urinal  next  to  the  toilet...  no  reason  for  me  to  hog  the  bathroom  to  shit  if  someone  wants  to  piss  next  to  me. __label__1

when  they  are  on  land  you  are  supposed  to  say  something  snarky  about  how  they  use  iphones  and  macbooks  even  though  they  are  protesting  a  corporation. __label__1
In  their  defense,  it  can  be  awfully  hard  to  see  a  massive  vehicle,  full  of  lit  windows,  that  is  all  the  way  across  the  road  way. __label__0
Yeah  it  obviously  hurt  KAT's  ability  to  shoot  long  2's  despite  being  the  only  player  to  shoot  50+  percent  and  lead  the  next  player  by  like  3  percent. __label__0
Come  on  man,  the  HOH  comp  was  over  like  2  hours  ago,  Natalie  should  be  over  it  already  and  have  accepted  she's  going  home  and  losing  the  game! __label__1
People  are  so  stupid  they  can't  be  trusted  to  vote  right  they're  all  just  sheep  democracy  doesn't  work  because  I'm  smarter  than  everyone  I  know  better __label__1
But  this  is  ok,  he  obviously  wasn't  a  responsible  gun  owner  so  there  is  nothing  that  could  have  stopped  this  except  more  good  guys  with  guns  around. __label__0
Green  Bay  is  just  way  to  small  of  a  market,  and  I  don't  think  there  is  a  loyal  enough  fan  base  to  justify  not  moving  the  team __label__1
It's  because  some  pro  players  used  it  so  it  obviously  has  to  be  the  best  thing  ever  and  if  you  use  it  you  win  and  are  considered  good. __label__0
I'm  sure  it  was  unrelated  that  Kap  said  he  would  opt  out  of  his  contract  that  morning  and  Kelly  benching  him  in  the  game  that  day __label__1
Soon,  this  article  will  be  followed  by  a  "scientific"  analysis  of  how  vegetarianism  has  caused  them  to  outlive  others  and  that  is  why  meat/beef  should  be  banned. __label__0
Well,  we  make  every  heterosexual  person  getting  married  get  tested  to  prove  they  are  fertile,  so  it's  reasonable  to  ban  gay  marriage  because  they  can't  be  fertile. __label__1
yes,  you  don't  micro  in  SC2  at  all,  you  just  A  move  queue  your  army  across,  that  usually  ends  up  winning  the  game  at  pro  level __label__0
So  it  seems  we  just  need  to  stop  showing  women  being  pleasured...that  is  much  worse  for  teens  to  see  than  the  horrific  violence  thats  allowed...yeah  that  makes  sense. __label__0
Well  according  to  a  friend  of  a  friend  of  mine  who  heard  it  from  some  guy  he  gave  a  quarter  to  at  some  corner,  that  won't  be  much  longer. __label__1
Cutthroat  Kitchen  gave  one  of  the  chefs  vegan  hot  dogs  as  a  sabotage,  but  that  means  watching  Food  Network  directly  supports  the  purchase  of  vegan  hot  dogs. __label__1
Shadow  man  is  freeza  haha  1st  form  is  the  old  guy  2nd  is  the  one  at  the  end  of  the  trailer  and  third  is  this  one __label__0
Yeah,  we  are  pretty  overpowered,  sucks  that  a  race  with  inherently  stronger  and  more  cost  efficient  units  can't  have  the  same  economy  as  a  zerg...terran  and  toss  need  buffs... __label__0
I  found  out  yesterday  that  my  department  at  work  is  essentially  going  to  be  changed  into  a  24/7  hotline  call  center...  So  I'm  Pretty  thrilled  about  that. __label__0
Sure  all  they  had  to  do  was  change  the  license-plate  and  maybe  a  bit  of  a  new  paint-job  and  they  could  have  gotten  away  with  it. __label__0
What  happens  in  the  future  when  craft  beer  is  popular  and  mainstream;  will  we  have  to  go  to  Coors  and  Budweiser  to  find  an  edgy,  rare,  underground  brand? __label__0

you  people  don't  understand,  sag  is  really  easy  to  fix:  just  put  the  computer  lying  down  with  the  port's  towards  the  ground  and  the  GPU's  will  not  sag! __label__0
I  would  be  fine  with  this  as  long  as  in  return  Pyro  gets  a  Sniper  Rifle  that  is  as  easy  to  use  as  the  flame  thrower. __label__0
If  a  defensive  play  stops  them  one  time,  I'm  pretty  sure  that  means  it  will  stop  them  again  the  next  3  plays,  no  matter  what  they  call. __label__1
^  Don't  listen  too  him,  scarfing  down  a  What-a-burger  Chop  House  burger  and  washing  it  down  with  a  six  pack  of  Shiner  is  more  fulfilling  then  working  out! __label__0

Don't  you  know  her  art  is  above  criticism,  because  it  is  a  manifestation  of  her  individuality  that  is  neither  influenced  by  societal  tropes  nor  meant  for  **public**  dissemination __label__0
Didn't  you  already  know  being  a  minority  itself  is  traumatic,  so  LGBT  people/PoC  are  ALL  trauma  survivors,  because  of  the  oppression  those  groups  face  all  day  every  day? __label__0
Well  don't  you  know  that  everyone  who  is  anti-Israel  or  even  not  100%  pro-Israel  is  automatically  a  clear  as  day  raging  anti-Semite  and  a  Holocaust  denier. __label__0
Because  your  manual  labor  employed  co-worker  ain't  gonna  have  to  pay  that  Doctor  bill  so  why  should  he  give  a  fuck  about  any  long  term  problems? __label__1
Yeah  man,  like  all  those  oil  companies  buying  up  the  patents  for  the  super  efficient  carburetors  and  shelving  them  so  they  can  keep  selling  lots  of  oil! __label__0

Well  he  does  appear  to  be  the  only  one  to  have  an  "Apple  Air",  so  obviously  he  has  access  to  equipment  the  rest  of  us  don't. __label__1
Yeah  I  hate  the  way  it  takes  more  than  a  few  days  to  get  a  legendary,  really  poor  decision  by  ANet  to  make  something  vaguely  time  consuming  to  get. __label__0

Well,  the  mother  was  told  her  child  was  possessed  by  evil  spirits,  which  is  a  perfectly  reasonable  attitude  in  this  day  and  age.....and  ah...  we  gotta  respect  her  beliefs. __label__0
Yup  all  the  problems  and  discrimination  that  black  people  faced  as  a  result  of  slavery  are  all  over  and  taken  care  of,  its  exactly  the  same  thing! __label__1
that  means  a  lot  coming  from  mr  bug  abuse  about  the  same  as  I  never  botted  in  my  life  jagex  I  swear  it  was  a  false  ban __label__0
Yeah,  because  it's  not  like  lesbian  women  have  ever  been  sexually  assaulted  by  men  who  thought  that  a  good  D  would  turn  them  straight  or  bi! __label__1
That'll  teach  those  pesky  home  renting  frugal  pensioners  who  have  to  be  uncomfortably  cold  to  save  money  by  not  using  any  form  of  heating  during  the  winter __label__1
And  it  isn't  like  people  have  been  ideologically  brainwashed  to  hate  rich  people  and  assume  they  are  all  crooks  who  ruin  the  economy  and  rape  the  world  right? __label__1
Did  you  consider  the  fact  that  not  everyone  wants  to  get  ahead  on  their  corporate  job,  which  in  the  long  run  is  usually  a  good  thing. __label__0
Clearly  it's  the  surprise  reveal  of  the  falcon,  reach  DMR,  pro  pipe,  and  invasion,  and  a  complete  remaster  of  Halo:  Reach  for  free  to  make  up  for  MCC __label__0
I'm  sure  that  infertile  women  who  can't  have  kids  and  instead  have  to  have  dogs  that  are  their  babies  would  totally  agree  with  these  "real"  moms. __label__0
Nice  of  them  to  broadcast  these  people's  mugshots  and  charges  so  that  we'll  know  what  these  monsters  look  like  when  they  go  on  to  commit  mass  murder. __label__0
Just  like  Obama  was  able  to  convince  the  nation  that  his  healthcare  law  was  in  their  best  interests  and  they  welcomed  it  with  open  arms  and  soaring  approval  ratings. __label__1
Since  plastic  surgery  is  clearly  addictive  and  dangerous,  shouldn't  we  ban  it  and  jail  anyone  who  has  anything  to  do  with  it  for  the  safety  of  the  children? __label__1
Oh  thanks  for  defining  hipster  for  me,  it'a  been  such  a  mystery  for  these  past  few  years  of  everybody  on  the  internet  pissing  all  over  them  and  complaining. __label__1
If  they  can't  afford  to  be  poor  in  WI,  maybe  they'll  all  move  to  MN  or  IL  and  it  will  help  our  state  in  the  long  run. __label__0
If  having  red  hot  blind  hatred  for  a  22  year  old  woman  that  I've  never  met  and  don't  know  at  all  is  wrong,  I  don't  wanna  be  right. __label__1

if  we  want  to  make  a  bad  tactical  decision  we  should  be  able  too,  i  want  a  40x  scope  on  my  mac  11  why  can't  i  have  it? __label__0
Now  remember,  you  only  own  a  LICENSE  to  use  that  software  and  the  vendor  will  happily  issue  replacement  media  for  a  nominal  fee  upon  proof  of  purchase. __label__0
Nah  he's  too  busy  helping  hundreds  of  people  in  his  awesome,  6  figure  private  sector  job,  saving  for  his  retirement  all  on  his  own,  since,  you  know,  Mexicans. __label__0
But  no,  this  cannot  be,  there  absolutely  must  be  a  thirdworld  hivemind  of  people  wanting  to  bring  down  Western  society  or  my  entire  worldview  will  crumble! __label__1
No  no  no  no,  Trump  got  the  most  opposing  delegate-nomination-votes  (  Not  American,  I'm  not  sure  what  they  were  called)  so  his  campaign  is  done  for! __label__1
Sure,  the  American  people  are  a  very  discerning  populace  that  constantly  look  for  and  identify  issues  in  rhetoric,  so  I'm  sure  that  will  diminish  the  rhetoric's  effectiveness. __label__0
Yeah,  because  taking  full  control  of  the  railways  and  marching  millions  of  men  through  a  small  country  will  have  no  negative  side  effects  to  the  country  affected. __label__0
you  must  be  soe  kinda  woman  hating  misogynistic  cis  gendered  white  man  for  not  voting  her  her,  SHE  HAS  A  VAGINA  and  that's  all  that  matters. __label__0
Yeah  instead  of  DoA  going  off  topic  in  a  lul,  I  really  prefer  Riv  reading  the  score  board  or  telling  us  how  someone  picks  up  a  buff. __label__0
You  don't  need  to  wear  helmets  all  the  time,  just  when  shit  like  that  happens,  you  can  go  like  99%  of  the  time  with  out  one. __label__0
His  intelligence  shines  like  the  sun  -  it  is  only  natural  that  we  mortal  avert  our  eyes  before  the  magnificence  that  we  can  not  understand  before  it  destroys  us. __label__0
I'm  sure  a  lawsuit  to  overturn  a  supermajority  of  the  public's  will  is  going  to  lead  to  really  favorable  election  results  for  all  those  officials  down  the  road. __label__0
I  simply  want  to  complain  about  things  I  entirely  made  up  and  do  not  want  to  provide  the  source  for  it  man,  don't  be  so  weird! __label__0
Ya  know  I  originally  thought  your  logic  was  bullshit,  but  that  cartoon  character  is  really  hot  so  I  think  I  might  have  to  agree  with  you. __label__0
Its  not  like  the  government  instituted  any  racist  policies,  nope  its  always  been  a  great  bastion  of  social  tolerance  and  the  best  friend  of  every  minority... __label__0
This  is  the  perfect  way  to  end  any  series  and  I  think  it's  just  going  to  go  down  in  history  as  the  best  for  a  very  long  time. __label__0
I  would  have  thought  top  priority  was  "update  character  nobody  uses"  and  "fail  to  nerf  pocket  sniper  and  Super90"  but  I  guess  cheating  is  important  too! __label__1
